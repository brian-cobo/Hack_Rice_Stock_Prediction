The electric-car maker reports quarterly production and deliveries within three days of each quarter's end. This means investors should get insight into its recent performance by no later than Wednesday.While investors will want to look into how well\xa0all of Tesla's vehicle models are selling, the Model 3 remains the primary focus for investors. Highlighting the Model 3's growing importance to Tesla's business, the vehicle accounted for nearly 70% of the automaker's trailing-12-month deliveries -- and that figure is expected to rise.When Tesla reports production and deliveries next week, can the Model 3 live up to investors' high expectations?In the first quarter of 2019,\xa0Tesla delivered about 51,000 Model 3s. While this was up 522% year over year, it was down 20% sequentially. Of course, Tesla was careful to point out that this was primarily due to a larger number of vehicles in transit to customers because of the company's international expansion during the quarter. In addition, it has clarified on several occasions that demand for Model 3 is\xa0not a problem. Indeed, earlier this week, CEO Elon Musk reportedly\xa0told employees in an email that there are enough vehicle orders in the current quarter to set a new record for total deliveries, implying that demand for Model 3 remains robust.With demand reportedly faring well, the big question is whether Model 3 production -- and Tesla's ability to deliver finished vehicles to customers -- was sufficient enough for the electric-car company to report record Model 3 deliveries.To set a new record for Model 3 deliveries in Q2, Tesla will need to deliver more than 63,359 units (the number of Model 3 units delivered in the fourth quarter of 2018).\xa0This would translate to 24% sequential growth and a staggering 243% increase over Model 3 deliveries in the year-ago quarter.Perhaps even more telling than second-quarter Model 3 deliveries will be any statements from management in next week's update about expectations for Model 3 production and deliveries throughout the rest of the year.In order for Tesla to hit its full-year guidance for 360,000 to 400,000 total vehicle deliveries in 2019, Model 3 deliveries are likely going to need to be higher in the second half of 2019 than they were in the first half. To gauge whether Tesla can pull off its ambitious outlook, look for updates on the Model 3 production rate and the most recent demand trends.Daniel Sparks\xa0owns shares of Tesla.

https://www.ibtimes.com/where-will-tesla-be-1-year-2801103,Where Will Tesla Be In 1 Year?,John Bromels,06/16/19,10:14 PM,"['To hear\xa0Tesla\xa0(NASDAQ:TSLA)\xa0CEO Elon Musk tell it, by next year Tesla will have overcome its recent financial challenges, will be operating a fleet of robotic taxis, and will offer cars that can drive themselves. Moreover, anyone with any other brand of car will be frustrated that he or she now owns the technological equivalent of a horse and buggy or a flip phone.Did he actually say all that? Yep, although he partially walked back the robotic-taxi comment later.Is it a complete fantasy? Maybe not entirely, but it\'s probably less likely than predicting that Tesla will wind up pretty much where it is today. But let\'s take a dive into Tesla\'s current situation to see if any of these things\xa0might\xa0come to pass by mid-2020.The mass-market conundrumIn the beginning, Tesla was a luxury automaker, with one product: the high-end luxury Tesla Roadster sportscar with its $90,000 price tag. Since then, the company has tried to broaden its appeal by ramping up production of less expensive cars, including the Model 3 sedan (starting price: $35,000), the upcoming Model Y crossover SUV (starting price: $47,000), and a possibly soon-to-be-unveiled electric pickup truck that will purportedly rival the\xa0Ford\xa0(NYSE:F)\xa0F-150 (starting price: ""less than $50,000"").The problem is that more expensive cars have higher margins. When you start selling less expensive vehicles -- and building giant Gigafactories and ramping up production to do so -- the amount of money you make per car takes a hit. Furthermore, when you\'re investing in technological innovations at the same time to ensure your cutting-edge vehicles stay on the cutting edge, it further eats into your available resources, even as it expands your potential customer base.The good news for Tesla is that some of those investments seem to be paying off. The company appears to be able to manufacture batteries for as much as 20% less than the competition, for one thing, and it\'s managed to notch a couple of\xa0profitable and free cash flow-positive\xa0quarters in Q3 and Q4 2018. If it can keep this up, Tesla might actually be in a stable financial and operational position next year.But there\'s one big problem.Cars on demandTesla posted back-to-back profitable quarters in Q3 and Q4 2018, but it sure didn\'t in Q1 2019. Worse, a\xa0lower-than-expected\xa0number of quarterly deliveries -- especially for the high-margin models X and S -- fueled speculation that demand for Teslas\xa0might be drying up. That problem may have been exacerbated by a federal tax credit decrease for purchasing a Tesla that kicked in Jan. 1. The tax credit will drop again, from $3,750 to just $1,875, on the first of July. It\'s also possible that potential Model X buyers are\xa0holding out\xa0for the less expensive Model Y, which is set to roll out in late 2020.Lower demand would be a big problem for the carmaker, which doesn\'t invest in traditional advertising such as TV commercials. It also shuttered most of its Tesla stores, relying instead on word of mouth and news coverage to spread the word about its cars.Luckily for Tesla, it gets a lot of news coverage. But if demand is already drying up for its existing models, and with the Model Y and electric pickup truck far from production, Tesla could find itself back in a precarious financial spot, with not enough revenue coming in to fund its new projects.For his part, Musk\xa0disputes that sales are declining. He says that both sales and orders for all three of Tesla\'s current models are outpacing production. But a leaked May email to employees warned that Tesla had only 10 months to become profitable and announced a ""hardcore"" cost-cutting program. Those aren\'t usually hallmarks of a financially healthy company.Pie in the skyWe\'ve all learned by now to take Musk\'s statements with a grain of salt. After all, I could spend pages and pages writing about the\xa0promises Musk has made\xa0that haven\'t come to fruition.His comments that autonomous driving would be ready by the end of 2019 seem particularly laughable, considering\xa0Consumer Reports\xa0just panned\xa0Tesla\'s Autopilot lane-changing feature as ""far behind a human driver\'s skills."" However, Musk recently scoffed at LIDAR technology -- essentially, a radar system that uses laser beams instead of radio waves -- which just about everyone in the autonomous-vehicle space uses\xa0except\xa0Tesla. Musk relies instead on vehicle-mounted cameras and radar systems. In other words, even if some of the regulatory hurdles to introducing this technology were worked out, it\'s not clear that existing Tesla vehicles would make the cut.For now, nobody, not even\xa0Alphabet\'s Waymo, seems anywhere close to rolling out a mass-market autonomous vehicle within the next year, LIDAR or no LIDAR. But the incident illustrates how Tesla may be trying to do too much all on its own. Other, larger companies that have more resources are teaming up with partners to develop electric-vehicle and automated-driving technology, including Waymo\'s partnerships with\xa0Fiat Chrysler\xa0and\xa0\xa0Tata Motors\'\xa0Jaguar, or\xa0Ford\'s with\xa0Volkswagen, or\xa0Hyundai\'s with\xa0start-up Aurora.Tesla\'s insistence on trying to beat the big guns may not work out so well.We were here firstOne thing that\'s unclear is whether people interested in buying a Tesla are more interested in buying an electric vehicle, or just buying a Tesla. Tesla\'s brand has been rapidly increasing in value, according to\xa0market researcher Kantar Millward Brown, to the point that it\'s now the eighth most valuable automotive brand.\xa0But as its competitors get ready to roll out electric vehicles of their own, potentially at similar or lower price points, will it have an impact on Tesla\'s sales?We\'ll find out sooner rather than later. Rival automaker Ford is\xa0planning to launch\xa0its own battery-electric crossover SUV based on the Mustang in 2020, and it\'s promising 300 miles of range.\xa0Kia\xa0is also expected to begin selling\xa0an all-electric version of the Soul\xa0that year. And unlike Tesla, Ford and Kia have pretty good track records when it comes to launching vehicles on time.Where that leaves TeslaSo given all of this, where is Tesla likely to be in a year?Well, barring a miracle, a completely self-driving fleet isn\'t going to happen. And considering Tesla hasn\'t managed to post more than two profitable quarters in succession, it\'s unlikely the company will have made much, if any, progress on putting its financial house in order. It would take sustained profitability to make that happen.A lot depends on whether the slump in Tesla sales is a blip or a trend. And with the slew of other options coming available in 2020, that\'s going to depend on whether consumers are really determined to get a Tesla in 2019 or whether they\'re willing to wait and explore other options. I\'m not so sure they won\'t wait, which would leave Tesla in a similar position to today: unprofitable and burning cash, but with hot prospects ""just around the corner.""Still, as with most things Tesla, I wouldn\'t bet against the stock based on that theory.Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool\'s board of directors.\xa0John Bromels owns shares of Alphabet (A shares), Alphabet (C shares), Ford, and Tesla.

A day later,\xa0Tesla launched an online contest in China for people to guess the price of the made-in-China Model 3 -- suggesting the mysterious announcement has something to do with a Chinese version of the vehicle.This planned announcement comes as Tesla is making significant progress on its Gigafactory Shanghai -- a factory for building Model 3 vehicles in Shanghai. The automaker hopes building vehicles in the country will reduce costs for Model 3 in the important market while increasing global production and deliveries.Bringing Model 3 to ChinaTesla\'s Gigafactory Shanghai is a massive undertaking that Tesla started to construct in January.\xa0Initially, the company is aiming for Model 3 production of 3,000 units per week in China. But Tesla doesn\'t expect to reach volume production of the vehicle until sometime between the fourth quarter of this year and the second quarter of 2020.""Local manufacturing is an essential component of our ability to provide to customers in the region a truly affordable version of Model 3,"" Tesla explained in its fourth-quarter shareholder letter.According to management\'s commentary on its Gigafactory Shanghai in Tesla\'s first-quarter shareholder letter, the China-based Model 3 production line will come online faster and more efficiently than the line at the company\'s factory in Fremont, California. ""Learning from our experience, we can now build a second-generation Model 3 line in China that we expect will be at least 50% cheaper per unit of capacity than our Model 3-related lines in Fremont and at Gigafactory 1,"" Tesla said.With Tesla planning a special announcement in China this week, it\'s possible that the automaker is planning to launch a version of Model 3 with specifications catering to the local market.A key catalystIt\'s no surprise Tesla is investing heavily in the country. Not only is China the world\'s largest auto market but it\'s been the source of a large portion of Tesla\'s growth in recent years. Revenue in China in 2018 was $1.8 billion, or 8% of total revenue. While revenue from China was higher in 2017, at $2 billion, the market\'s revenue was only $1.1 billion in 2016\xa0and $319 million in 2015.Further, a local market will not only help reduce manufacturing costs but help Tesla bypass Chinese import tariffs, making the Model 3 as competitive as possible when it comes to price.This article originally appeared in the Motley Fool.Daniel Sparks\xa0has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

https://www.ibtimes.com/tesla-doomed-2795097,Is Tesla Doomed?,Adam Levine-Weinberg,05/26/19,9:12 PM,"['Tesla\xa0(NASDAQ:TSLA)\xa0has been a battleground stock for many years. But for most of 2019 -- and especially the past couple of months -- the news has been almost all bad.As a result, Tesla shares have lost nearly half of their value since mid-December. Last week, the stock broke below the $200 mark for the first time since late 2016. Some Wall Street experts are now saying that Tesla may need to restructure or even declare bankruptcy in the face of falling demand for its electric vehicles.Does this mean that Tesla is doomed? Let\'s take a look.Demand is saggingWarning signs have been piling up for Tesla investors since the beginning of the year. The first sign that something was amiss was when Tesla implemented\xa0multiple price changes\xa0for its vehicle lineup during the first quarter. This seemed to suggest that demand was fading.These fears were confirmed in early April. Tesla reported that it delivered just 63,000 vehicles in the quarter, down from more than 90,000 a quarter earlier. Most troublingly, the company\xa0delivered just 12,100\xa0of its highly profitable Model S and Model X vehicles in the period -- down 56% sequentially and down 44% year over year.It was inevitable that this would negatively impact Tesla\'s earnings, but the damage was even worse than what most expected. Tesla posted a Q1 loss of $4.10 per share -- $2.90 per share excluding stock-based compensation -- and it used up $1.5 billion of its $3.7 billion cash stash, between its negative free cash flow and the repayment of $920 million of debt. This gave the company little choice but to raise more capital in early May.There have been more troubling signs in the past month. On May 16, CEO Elon Musk sent an\xa0email to all employees, asking them to ""examine every expenditure at Tesla no matter how small"" to find savings. This could be a simple attempt to maximize efficiency. However, in the past, Tesla\'s radical cost-savings plans have been correlated with big losses. (For example, the company abruptly decided to shutter most of its retail locations in the midst of its poor financial performance last quarter.) So the latest cost-saving plan doesn\'t bode well.Even more recently,\xa0Consumer Reports\xa0panned Tesla\'s Autopilot system, saying it\'s not close to being ready for prime time. This further emphasizes that Musk\'s prediction of fully self-driving Teslas being on the road by the end of next year is preposterous.The first quarter may have been unusually toughAs bad as the recent news has been, Tesla may not be in as much danger as some bears believe. First, the big loss and rapid cash burn last quarter were exacerbated by the timing of deliveries during the period. About 10,600 vehicles were in transit to customers at the end of the quarter -- and thus delivered early in Q2 -- compared to fewer than 3,000 a quarter earlier.The resulting decrease in revenue and increase in inventory hurt Tesla\'s first-quarter earnings and cash flow. That timing impact should at least partially reverse this quarter.Second, during Tesla\'s earnings call last month, Musk opined that order activity would\xa0accelerate over the course of 2019. There\'s been some evidence of that so far. A recent leaked email apparently from Musk stated that Tesla had already surpassed 50,000 net new vehicle orders since the beginning of the second quarter. That puts it on pace for perhaps 90,000 net new orders in the quarter, which lines up with the low end of its deliveries guidance.Together, these two factors suggest that Tesla will achieve much better earnings and cash flow in the second quarter than it did a quarter ago. (Whether it actually generates positive free cash flow is less clear.)However, U.S. Tesla buyers will face another drop in the federal tax credit as of July 1, which could hurt the company\'s sales momentum. Meanwhile, by the end of this quarter, Tesla will have met most of the initial surge of Model 3 demand in international markets. As a result, the growth that the company is counting on in the second half of 2019 may not materialize.Two things could decide Tesla\'s fateThe evidence isn\'t clear-cut one way or the other, but demand for Tesla\'s three current vehicles seems to be plateauing short of the 500,000-per-year mark that the company has long targeted. Additionally, Tesla has had to significantly reduce prices for the Model S and Model X, while Model 3 demand is normalizing toward more affordable variants, pressuring margins.Barring another sharp drop in demand, bankruptcy probably isn\'t a big risk at this point. That said, Tesla isn\'t necessarily on track for a return to profitability at any point in 2019.That means the Tesla bull case increasingly relies on two future developments: the opening of Tesla\'s new factory in China and the\xa0launch of the Model Y. Building vehicles in China will reduce costs and allow Tesla to sidestep a massive tariff bill. That could potentially enable lower prices, stimulating sales. Meanwhile, the Model Y compact crossover could become far more popular than the Model 3, as demand has shifted dramatically from cars to crossovers.In theory, the China factory should open in late 2019, and Model Y production should begin in late 2020. However, Tesla has a long track record of missing deadlines.With the company having no clear path to sustainable profitability with its current products in its current markets, missing these deadlines could pose grave risks to Tesla.Adam Levine-Weinberg\xa0has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

It is expensive and unnecessary. Once you solve vision, it is worthless.”Tesla uses a range of cameras to visualize the roadway and send data to the vehicle’s computer, allowing for navigation in traffic while lidar uses sensors that can see around vehicles, helping self-driving cars maneuver through traffic.Aurora is not the only company that has a strong belief in the viability of lidar in autonomous vehicles as Google’s Waymo, General Motors, and other automakers have invested in the technology and are making headway with development and testing, the news outlet reported.Shares of Tesla stock were down 1.58 percent as of 10:32 a.m. ET on Friday.']"
https://www.ibtimes.com/tesla-deliveries-might-surge-q2-2794484,Tesla Deliveries Might Surge In Q2,Daniel Sparks,05/23/19,9:05 PM,"['In an email from\xa0Tesla\xa0(NASDAQ:TSLA)\xa0CEO Elon Musk to employees this week is any indication of how vehicle deliveries for the electric-car company may fare this quarter, they\'ll jump both sequentially and year over year. The news is reassuring, as a growing number of analysts and investors are worried about demand for the vehicles.Will Tesla report record deliveries?""Based on current trends, we have a good chance of exceeding the record 90,700 deliveries of Q4 last year and making this the highest deliveries/sales quarter in Tesla history!"" said Musk in an email to employees Wednesday night, according to the website\xa0Electrek.If Tesla can deliver 91,000 vehicles in its second quarter, this would represent a 44% and 123% sequential and year-over-year increase, respectively. In addition, this would put trailing-12-month vehicle deliveries up nearly 160% year over year.Notably, management guided for 90,000 to 100,000\xa0deliveries in the company\'s first-quarter shareholder letter. But there have been concerns that Tesla was overly optimistic about its guidance for the period. Wednesday night\'s email from Musk suggests Tesla\'s guidance may be within reach after all.The record quarter would follow Tesla\'s\xa0worse-than-expected deliveries\xa0in Q1. Deliveries during the period suffered from a sharp drop in Model S and X orders following a pull-forward of demand for the two vehicles in Q4 as U.S. customers aimed to take delivery before the U.S. electric vehicle tax credit was cut in half. In addition, troubles with shipping the Model 3 overseas hurt the quarter\'s delivery tally.Can Tesla build enough vehicles?The wording of Musk\'s email suggests supply is the primary constraint for deliveries during the quarter. To surpass its record-high deliveries achieved in Q4, Tesla needs ""sustained output of 1,000 Model 3\'s per day,"" Musk said.He continued: ""Almost all parts of the Model 3 production system have exceeded 1,000 units on multiple days (congratulations!!) and we\'ve averaged about 900/day this week, so we\'re only about 10% away from 7,000/week.""If Tesla ""rallies hard,"" the company can achieve this, Musk said in the email.Growth is a key for profitabilityExecution on its growth plans is crucial for Tesla since higher deliveries lead to improved economies of scale and -- ultimately -- profitability. The automaker demonstrated this in Q4 when\xa0record deliveries\xa0helped Tesla achieve positive free cash flow of $910 million and earnings per share of $0.78.While Tesla isn\'t expecting to be profitable in its second quarter on a\xa0GAAP\xa0basis, management did guide for positive free cash flow during the period. To become profitable on a GAAP basis as well, deliveries will need to continue to rise throughout the year. ""As the impact of higher deliveries and cost reduction take full effect, we expect to return to profitability in Q3 and significantly reduce our loss in Q2,"" management said in Tesla\'s first-quarter shareholder letter.Daniel Sparks\xa0owns shares of Tesla.

https://www.ibtimes.com/2-million-us-solar-installations-are-just-start-2793584,2 Million US Solar Installations Are Just The Start,Travis Hoium,05/21/19,12:00 AM,"[""The solar industry in the U.S. is now so large that 2 million separate installations are in service across the country,\xa0according to\xa0Wood Mackenzie Power & Renewables and the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA). Projects can be as big as a few square miles, but most are small, with 96% of the installations on residential rooftops. This type of installation is the specialty of\xa0Tesla\xa0(NASDAQ:TSLA),\xa0Sunrun\xa0(NASDAQ:RUN), and\xa0Vivint Solar\xa0(NYSE:VSLR).\xa0The big projects are built by companies like\xa0First Solar\xa0(NASDAQ:FSLR)\xa0and financed by utilities and asset owners like\xa0NextEra Energy Partners\xa0(NYSE:NEP)\xa0and\xa0TerraForm Power(NASDAQ:TERP), which have put billions of dollars into their solar projects.It took the industry over 40 years to reach 2 million installations, but analysts now expect the next 2 million to take just four years to install. As the industry grows in both scale and geographic reach, it creates more opportunities for investors.Where solar energy is goingAccording to\xa0the SEIA's data, California accounted for 51% of the first 1 million solar installations in the U.S., so it is certainly the industry's hub. But among the second million, the state accounted for only 43% of installations, so geographic diversity is improving. In the last few years, states like Florida, Texas, and Minnesota have opened up as large growth markets, and economics, not subsidies, are driving the industry's growth.Large-scale projects continue to account for a minority of installations, but a vast majority of new solar capacity.\xa0According to the SEIA, in 2018, 58% of the 10.6 gigawatts (GW) of solar power installed was for utility-scale projects. This indicates a big opportunity for companies like First Solar, NextEra Energy Partners, and TerraForm Power if they land the big projects that get built.On a broad level, solar energy is starting to have a big impact on electricity production overall. In 2018, large solar projects accounted for 1.5% of the electricity produced in the U.S. and production was up 37 times from 2011. At the rate solar is being installed, it will take about two to three years to account for another 1% of production, and if current trends continue, it could overtake coal in market share by the end of the next decade. The solar industry is here to stay, and it's getting bigger by the day.Who's leading the way?I mentioned that the three leaders in the number of\xa0solar installations are residential installers. Today, Sunrun has the market share lead, followed by Vivint Solar and Tesla. They're doing the hard work of pushing individual solar installations forward on a small scale. The business has proven to be up and down financially, with most companies reporting net losses, but they control the largest number of installations overall.SunPower\xa0(NASDAQ:SPWR)\xa0is the one company to watch in the commercial solar market. This consists of installations on big-box retailers and school carports, where solar can be installed close to demand. The company has the leading market share in the industry and is adding energy storage to more than one-third of commercial solar installs. Like residential solar, margins are weak in the commercial segment, but if SunPower can use scale and improving solar panel efficiency to improve costs, it could be a big winner in solar long-term.Utility solar is highly competitive, and the one company that stands out is First Solar. The company is among the largest solar manufacturers in the world and expects to have $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion of net cash on the balance sheet at the end of 2019, which compares to billions in debt for most solar companies. First Solar provides parts and sometimes does development, so the other part of the market to keep an eye on is asset ownership by companies like NextEra Energy Partners and TerraForm Power. The companies use the cash flow from operations to pay dividends, which currently stand at 4.3% and 5.9% respectively. For investors looking for stability and cash flow from solar stocks, these are a great place to start.A trend that won't be stoppedWhether you invest in solar stocks or not, the industry is worth watching because it has the potential to upend everything we know about energy.\xa0More solar energy hits the earth every hour than the world consumes in an entire year, so this is by far the most abundant source of energy on earth. The cost of solar power is also coming down so quickly that in competitive electricity markets it's beating coal, natural gas, nuclear, and wind on an unsubsidized basis.Solar energy has its challenges, like energy storage for off-peak hours and seasons, but the starting point of a cost structure low enough to compete with fossil fuels is already established. Even tariffs have done little to slow the solar industry, and with 2 million installations under its belt and a growing market share of U.S. energy markets, it's an industry that could cause major disruptions in the future.This article originally appeared in the Motley Fool.Travis Hoium\xa0has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

https://www.ibtimes.com/tesla-cut-costs-again-2792924,Tesla To Cut Costs (Again),Daniel Sparks,05/17/19,4:10 PM,"['Tesla\xa0(NASDAQ:TSLA) is undergoing another round of cost cuts, electric-vehicle news website Electrek\xa0reported\xa0Thursday afternoon. In an email to employees, CEO Elon Musk detailed a concerted effort to eliminate all unnecessary costs.This cost-cutting initiative follows several recent big programs from the company to reduce expenses and cut any avoidable capital expenditures. Amid the Model 3 production ramp-up last year, Tesla moved to 24/7 operations at its factory in Fremont Factory while simultaneously implementing a plan for the company\'s finance team to\xa0review all large expenses. Then, earlier this year, Tesla announced\xa0a 7% reduction to its full-time workforce.The electric-car company\'s latest cost-cutting initiative comes as Tesla is trying to move closer to becoming sustainably profitable after reporting a big loss in its first quarter.Getting ""hardcore""Executives at Tesla, including CFO Zach Kirkhorn and Musk himself, will be reviewing all expenses. It is ""extremely important"" to ""examine every expenditure at Tesla, no matter how small,"" Musk said in the email, which was obtained by Electrek. The company only has ""about 10 months at the Q1 burn rate to achieve breakeven!"" Musk added.Examples of payments to be examined as part of the program include ""parts, salary, travel expenses, and rent,"" Musk said. He admitted the program is ""hardcore,"" but said it\'s ""the only way for Tesla to become financially sustainable and succeed in our goal of helping make the world environmentally sustainable.""Financial troublesThe capital-intensive nature of the automobile business is weighing heavily on Tesla as the company attempts to deliver its most affordable and highest-volume vehicle yet -- the Model 3 -- in more markets.In Tesla\'s first quarter of 2019, the company lost $702 million.\xa0In addition, negative free cash flow and the repayment of a $920 million bond meant Tesla\'s cash position fell $1.5 billion sequentially to $2.2 billion.\xa0Worse-than-expected total vehicle deliveries\xa0as the company\'s overseas expansion faced more challenges than expected and as Model S and X shipments tanked didn\'t help.Helping buffer its financial headwinds, the company\xa0raised $2.7 billion\xa0in capital through equity and debt earlier this month. But, as of Tesla\'s first-quarter update in late April, management doesn\'t expect to be profitable on a GAAP basis until the third quarter of this year. It\'s no surprise, therefore, that it\'s focusing intensely on reducing expenses.Tesla investors should look for the automaker to eventually achieve a level of financial stability, allowing it to avoid such regular cost-cutting initiatives. Programs like this may take management\'s eye off the bigger picture and delay longer-term plans.This article originally appeared in The Motley Fool.Daniel Sparks\xa0owns shares of Tesla.

Now a new SEC filing shows he followed through, loading up on the maximum amount of shares he said he was interested in buying.The CEO\'s move to buy shares comes as the stock is trading significantly lower than the last time he did so. This purchase, combined with Musk\'s decision to hold on to his massive stake through the stock\'s tumultuous run in recent years, highlights the CEO\'s confidence in the company\'s long-term prospects.102,880 sharesWhen Tesla first announced an equity and debt offering last week, Musk initially disclosed an interest in\xa0buying up to $10 million\xa0of Tesla stock. But the CEO updated his stance the next day, saying he was considering purchasing up to $25 million worth of stock.Musk put his money where his mouth is. An SEC filing published on Tesla\'s website on Monday revealed he bought 102,880 shares at a price of $243, or $25 million worth.The CEO is getting shares at a discount compared to the prices he paid for the stock last year. As\xa0Barron\'s\xa0points out, Musk bought nearly $45 million worth of Tesla stock on the open market last year, paying an average price of $331.Buying and holding...foreverWhile there may be reasons to be critical when it comes to Musk\'s leadership tactics, his commitment to being a long-term shareholder is not one of them.Not only does the CEO have a near-20% stake in the company, he also has sold shares only to fulfill tax obligations.\xa0And Musk has publicly committed to\xa0being the last one to cash out, telling an audience in Germany in late 2013, ""I will be the last one to sell shares.""Of course, there\'s no guarantee Musk will keep his public commitment to hold on to his stake. In addition, he will likely continue to occasionally sell shares to fulfill tax obligations or, perhaps, participate in charitable giving. But given his unwavering commitment to remaining a major Tesla shareholder so far, combined with his new $25 million purchase of Tesla stock, it\'s unlikely Musk has any plans to sell.Tesla shareholders may have had a rough run over the past year, with shares declining 15% as the S&P 500 index has risen 8%. But they can comfort themselves with the knowledge that Musk\'s massive stake has similarly taken a hit. Further, with nearly a fifth of the company owned by Musk, you can bet he has a vested interest in trying to create long-term value so that the stock can eventually turn upward.This article originally appeared in the Motley Fool.Daniel Sparks\xa0owns shares of Tesla.

He then continued to hammer at the founder of Tesla Inc and SpaceX.“Napoleon once said, ‘Never interrupt your enemy when he’s making a mistake,’ so I won’t,” said Einhorn.“Just watch the screen.”Einhorn then unleashed a few choice slides showing Musk’s frowning face behind Musk’s failed or frivolous promises and proclamations. Among these digs at Musk:“It’s financially insane to buy anything other than a Tesla. They will be like owning a horse in three years,” -- Elon Musk, April 22, 2019“A Tesla will be worth $150,000 to $250,000 in 3 years.” -- Elon Musk, May 2, 2019“That’s a lot of horses--t,” asserted Einhorn.He reinforced this diatribe with a slide of a poop emoji replacing Musk’s face, inspiring some laughter from the audience.His running feud with Musk and Tesla goes back years and is the stuff of tech folklore.In August 2018, Musk sent Einhorn a pair of short shorts to console one of the world’s highest-paid hedge fund managers for losing millions in a failed attempt to short Tesla’s stock price. Einhorn showed off the shorts in a tweet and got back at Musk by writing:“I want to thank @elonmusk for the shorts. He is a man of his word!\xa0 They did come with some manufacturing defects. #tesla.”Shares of Tesla rose nearly 30 percent in the second quarter of 2018, making it the second-biggest losing position for Einhorn’s fund, Greenlight Capital, according to Bloomberg.Einhorn continued to slam Musk by telling Greenlight clients Tesla still has problems with cash flow, efficient production capabilities and increasing competition.“The odd thing is that while investors claim to be interested in the long-term growth of TSLA (as the valuation certainly can’t be supported by the current loss-making enterprise), the company is focusing investors on very short-term goals,” said a Greenlight note to its clients.']"

A larger capital raise could help Tesla fortify its balance sheet and give it more flexibility -- and a greater cash buffer -- as it spends heavily to accelerate Model 3 production and deliveries.Raising capitalOn Friday, Tesla announced Friday it would raise up to $2.7 billion in its offering, instead of the $2.3 billion it said it would raise on Thursday. This includes a combination of 3.1 million shares, or up to 3.5 million shares when including additional shares available to underwriters.

Musk also said a full self-driving upgrade will increase the value of any Tesla by a half order of magnitude, or five times.Musk again lavished praise on Tesla’s self-driving strategy, telling investors autonomous driving will transform Tesla into a company with a $500 billion market cap.\xa0He said that while Tesla drivers need to be hands-on today, this human oversight will become less necessary over time. Musk boasted that competitors such as GM’s Cruise and Alphabet’s Waymo can’t catch up because Tesla has a fleet of connected cars on the road today. It also has a proprietary chip that enables its vision for self-driving cars, and is also developing its own self-driving computers.Musk pointed out the hundreds of thousands of Teslas on the road today constantly absorb data and transmit this data to Tesla’s servers. This continuous data loop helps Tesla improve and advance its Autopilot and Full Self-Driving systems.Musk said Tesla expects to have one million EVs on the road in 2020 and be able to function as ""robotaxis,"" confirming statements he made at Tesla’s Autonomy Day last week. He said each car should be able to do 100 hours of work a week for its owner, making money as a robotaxi.In the same investors’ call, Tesla announced plans to raise a total of $2 billion ($650 million in equity and $1.35 billion in convertible bonds) it will use for general corporate purposes. Citigroup and Goldman Sachs are underwriting Tesla’s effort to raise the $2 billion.Musk said Tesla would rather fund its business needs through cash flow, but believes it wiser to have a buffer in the event of a recession or weak global auto demand.Tesla CFO Zach Kirkhorn told investors that nothing has changed in Tesla’s outlook for Q2. He said Tesla still expects to deliver 90,000 to 100,000 EVs in Q2, and 360,000 to 400,000 EVs for the full year.He admitted Tesla lost $702.1 million ($4.10 a share) on an unadjusted basis during Q1.

The news has shares up nearly 1 percent in after-hours trading on Friday as of 6:58 p.m. EDT, likely because the settlement involves no punishment for Musk or Tesla.A long battleThis settlement is part of a long battle between the SEC and Musk, all dating back to\xa0Musk\'s tweet last summer\xa0about possibly taking the company private. ""Am considering taking Tesla private at $420.

https://www.ibtimes.com/tesla-declares-war-waymos-lidar-technology-2787767,Tesla Declares War On Waymo's Lidar Technology,Billy Duberstein,04/24/19,11:40 PM,"['Tesla\xa0(NASDAQ:TSLA)\xa0CEO Elon Musk threw tons of shade this week at Waymo, Alphabet\'s (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\xa0self-driving car unit. The issue he raises could make all the difference in the race to autonomous vehicle supremacy.Speaking at the Tesla\'s recent\xa0Autonomy Day\xa0event, Musk called Waymo\'s lidar technology ""friggin\' stupid""\xa0and ""a crutch."" Lidar sensors are used by virtually every company attempting to build an autonomous car today\xa0except\xa0Tesla. Should Musk be proven right on this issue, Tesla would have a material advantage over its rivals in the coming age of driverless vehicles.That would be hugely consequential for not only Tesla investors, but also shareholders in Alphabet,\xa0NVIDIA, and other companies that are looking toward\xa0autonomous driving\xa0as a catalyst for future growth.With that in mind, let\'s dissect how lidar works, how Tesla\'s approach is different, and which side may come out the winner in this debate.Lidar explainedLidar, an acronym for Light Detection and Ranging, illuminates its surroundings with pulsed lasers, then uses sensors that can detect the pulse reflections to map objects up to about 200 meters away. If you\'ve seen a self-driving car near you -- likely in California or Arizona -- and you\'ve noticed the large hardware stack on the\xa0vehicle\'s roof, that\'s the lidar sensor array.While lidar takes care of most of the heavy lifting for Waymo, all autonomous vehicle prototypes today use a combination of sensors to map objects around them. That\'s because lidar has some detection issues. These include:Finally, lidar has traditionally been very expensive -- the sensors required to outfit just one vehicle cost upwards of $75,000. However, Waymo says its team has cut the cost of its proprietary sensors down by 90% to only about $7,500. Waymo recently announced it will be\xa0selling its proprietary lidar sensors\xa0to select partners in the fields of robotics, security, and agricultural technology -- though not to its self-driving competitors.How Tesla\'s autonomous system is differentIn contrast, Tesla\'s autonomous driving system depends on a combination of radar, ultrasonic, and passive visual sensors (cameras) to map its surroundings. Of the three, Tesla most emphasizes its next-gen cameras, which work in combination with its own neural network. That neural network is powered by Tesla\'s proprietary computer chip, which was also unveiled at the Autonomy Day event.Musk and Senior Director of Artificial Intelligence Andrej Karparthy both said that, with the power of AI and massive data sets, cameras can be trained to work better than lidar sensors. Karparthy made the point that lidar would have trouble distinguishing between a plastic bag and a rubber tire at a similar distance. On the other hand, cameras, combined with a supercomputer accessing a massive data set, can train Tesla\'s autonomous vehicle system to distinguish between types of objects.Training a computer to do this task accurately takes a lot of work, but that\'s where Musk claims Tesla has another advantage. All recently sold Teslas are constantly collecting visual data when they are on the road. Musk said, ""Whether autopilot is on or off, the network is being trained. Every mile that\'s driven for the car that\'s (equipped with) hardware 2 or above is training the network.""Them\'s fighting wordsCuriously, Alphabet itself does a lot of work on this type of visual AI within Google. That leads one to wonder why Waymo is so focused on lidar technology over camera-based sensors if Musk\'s claims about the latter\'s superiority were true. It\'s possible that since Waymo doesn\'t have as many cars on the road as Tesla, it isn\'t collecting as much data with which to train its neural engine. However, Waymo\'s self-driving vehicles have racked up more miles on the road than any of its pure self-driving peers, and\xa0many more in simulation.\xa0If cameras and AI were the way to go, one would think Waymo would have recognized that and switched over to the superior, but tougher, technology. After all, Alphabet isn\'t shy about taking its time with its ""Other Bets."" Still, Musk asserts that lidar is a ""crutch.""Musk made a number of other bold statements on Autonomy Day, including an assertion that Tesla will have a million robotaxis on the road sometime in 2020. That\'s right -- Musk basically said that Tesla will become an autonomous-vehicle Uber\xa0within a year and a half.Given the regulatory hurdles around self-driving and the other factors involved in scaling up a ride-hailing business, let\'s just say I\'m skeptical that his prediction is totally accurate.\xa0 In fact, most analysts that attended the event\xa0were pretty skeptical\xa0about the whole presentation, especially that part.Nevertheless, if Musk proves right about which autonomous vehicle vision technology is the best, Tesla is poised to be a huge winner, since it\'s following a technological path that no other autonomous vehicle company is on.This article originally appeared in the Motley Fool.Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool\'s board of directors.\xa0Billy Duberstein\xa0owns shares of Alphabet (C shares) and NVIDIA.

But they've gained very little traction, and now they all seem to be giving in to the reality that EVs have won.Giving up on a dreamNo one investing in fuel cells has officially given up on the technology because there are applications for it even if it's not for passenger vehicles. But there are plenty of signs that automakers are moving on to more fully electric options.Toyota's push will start with hybrids, where it pioneered partially electric driving with the Prius. It recently announced a Highlander Hybrid that could get a combined 34 miles per gallon to add to Prius, Rav4 Hybrid, Camry Hybrid, and others. Toyota isn't going all electric yet, but it's getting close with a growing hybrid lineup.Honda has announced an all-electric platform that is aimed at urban drivers. It's expected to launch in 2020 with modest production goals of about 5,000 units the first year. That's small for Honda but a step toward EVs that may make the Clarity fuel cell obsolete.Hyundai may have made the\xa0biggest leap from fuel cells to EVs\xa0with the 124-mile-range Ioniq Electric and the 258-mile-range Kona Electric. The company could be a major player in EVs over the long term, with a long range and compelling price points starting below $40,000.    A bank of Tesla Superchargers Photo: Tesla, Inc.  EVs have reached scaleAccording to\xa0InsideEVs, 2.02 million electric or hybrid electric vehicles were sold worldwide in 2018, with 361,307 units being sold in the U.S.\xa0Tesla\xa0(NASDAQ:TSLA)\xa0is the biggest name in EVs today, with three of the top four best-selling vehicles in 2018, but Toyota, Honda, and\xa0General Motors\xa0(NYSE:GM)\xa0are starting to reach scale in the tens of thousands of units as well.This compares to 2,300 fuel-cell vehicles sold in the U.S. in 2018,\xa0according to InsideEVs. Scale is critical in any manufacturing business, and EVs have a huge scale advantage over hydrogen today.Hydrogen has a placeNone of this is to say that hydrogen doesn't have a place somewhere in the market. Buses, local delivery trucks, and long-haul vehicles will see value in hydrogen's quick fueling and longer range than electric options. Material handling applications also appear to be gaining traction in factories and warehouses.What's tough to dispute is that the hydrogen fuel cell dream is all but dead for the passenger vehicle market. EVs have improved by leaps and bounds, increasing range and lowering charge time so that there's very little disruption to the average consumer's travel. Now all that's left is for the former hydrogen-focused manufacturers to play catch-up with Tesla, GM, and others, which may be easier said than done.This article originally appeared in the Motley Fool.Travis Hoium\xa0has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

If that growth materializes, the industry's stocks could continue climbing.\xa02019 Should Be A Big YearMeasurements of solar installations are opaque because countries don't track installations effectively, but most analysts are expecting a record year.\xa0Bloomberg New Energy Financeexpects solar installations to grow from 109 gigawatts (GW) in 2018 to 125 GW to 141 GW in 2019, or enough to power\xa023.1 million U.S. homes.China continues to be the biggest story in solar, but it's supposed to fall from about 55% of the market in 2017 to 19% by 2023, according to Wood Mackenzie.\xa0It isn't that China is giving up on solar, but rather that the technology is becoming more economical in other countries. Saudi Arabia, India, Chile, and parts of Africa are finding that solar energy is the cheapest form of new power generation, making it an easy choice.\xa0Manufacturers Finally See A Ray Of HopeFor manufacturers like First Solar, SunPower, and JinkoSolar, there's finally some hope that\xa0growing demand will result in rising profits. Price pressure tends to ease when the industry grows, and it helps that very few manufacturers have the scale to compete with these large rivals.\xa0Differentiation is also starting to become more important because developers are trying to squeeze more power generation from each acre or rooftop. First Solar is upgrading to a Series 6 technology that lowers costs and squeezes slightly more power from each solar panel. SunPower is expanding A-Series production, which makes panels as efficient as 22.8% when turning the sun's energy into electricity,\xa0and is also expanding commodity cell-based P-Series panels, which have achieved over 19% efficiency consistently.In China, JinkoSolar will upgrade nearly all of its cell capacity to produce PERC technology panels, which creates a more efficient cell than older technology.All of these technology improvements will help expand differentiation, increase margins, and if all goes well increase profits.\xa0Residential Solar Becomes Big Business AgainResidential solar continues to expand its market as more states find solar economical. Florida, Texas, and Nevada are growing, and establishing policies that should keep the industry growing for years to come.\xa0Installations have grown each quarter, rising 520 megawatts (MW) installed in the third quarter of 2018 to 640 MW installed in the fourth quarter of 2018. And with\xa0SolarCity's rapid decline under\xa0Tesla's\xa0 (NASDAQ: TSLA) \xa0ownership, Sunrun, SunPower, and Vivint Solar are gaining market share. If industry growth continues and these installers gain share, they will be set up for a great 2019.\xa0Bright Skies AheadIf the solar industry does hit record installations in 2019 and companies can outline differentiation as highlighted above, it could keep solar stocks pushing higher.

The update, which brought Tesla vehicles a step closer to autonomous driving, highlighted how rapidly the automaker can deploy a significant new feature -- all through a seamless over-the-air update.Here\'s a look.Navigate on Autopilot gets a major upgradeOn Wednesday, Tesla announced an update for its Navigate on Autopilot feature, making it ""more seamless.""Navigate on Autopilot is a feature that started rolling out to customers last October, enabling highway on-ramp to off-ramp navigation based on a driver\'s designated destination. But the driver-assist feature fell short of a total on-ramp to off-ramp experience: Although it made lane changes for the driver, the driver had to approve suggested lane changes with the turn stalk. Tesla\'s latest update for Navigate on Autopilot importantly removes the requirement to confirm lane changes and gives customers more control over the feature through the Autopilot settings menu.Specifically, the over-the-air update gives drivers three settings to choose from. One setting lets drivers choose whether Navigate on Autopilot is turned on automatically (for the highway portion of the drive) every time a driver enters a navigation route. A second setting gives drivers the option to require a confirmation from the driver before lane changes are executed. Finally, a third option gives drivers an option to be notified of an upcoming lane change with an audible chime and a visual prompt.With the help of the company\'s internal testing and Early Access Program, over ""a half a million miles have already been driven with lane change confirmation turned off,"" Tesla said in its update this week. This validation, combined with the company\'s over-the-air update technology, means Tesla was able to start rolling out updates to owners who have purchased enhanced autopilot or prepurchased full self-driving capability immediately.This over-the-air update joins a few other notable updates recently, including one earlier this month that improved the range and acceleration of Tesla\'s long-range Model 3\xa0and a feature that enables Tesla vehicles to slowly, autonomously navigate through parking lots to their owners.\xa0Just the beginningBased on another announcement from Tesla last week, there\'s apparently much more to come on this front. The company announced it is unveiling its in-house-developed\xa0full self-driving (FSD) computer\xa0at an event in Palo Alto, California, on April 22.\xa0At the event, Tesla executives will discuss the computer and give test-drives to experience features that are ""under active development.""While\xa0manufacturing\xa0has been -- and continues to be -- the electric-car maker\'s greatest challenge, software could represent its most important opportunity. Even more, Tesla\'s ability to quickly and seamlessly roll out such substantial software updates shows how the company\'s software prowess may give Tesla a significant technological edge over competitors.This article originally appeared in The Motley Fool.Daniel Sparks\xa0owns shares of Tesla.

https://www.ibtimes.com/silver-lining-teslas-deliveries-update-model-3-demand-2783342,The Silver Lining In Tesla's Deliveries Update: Model 3 Demand,Daniel Sparks,04/05/19,2:56 AM,"['Tesla\'s\xa0(NASDAQ:TSLA)\xa0first-quarter deliveries missed estimates by a significant margin, sparking\xa0a sharp sell-off\xa0in the electric automaker\'s stock on Thursday. The company produced and delivered 77,100 and 63,000 vehicles, respectively, in the period. Those were meaningful sequential decreases, and missed analysts\' average estimates for 84,700 produced and 74,900 delivered.Despite that, there was an important silver lining in the Q1 update: Model 3 demand remains strong. Recent price cuts and a reduction to the company\'s workforce earlier this year had\xa0led some watchers to worry that demand might be slacking off for the company\'s newest vehicle. But those concerns may be overblown.Robust Model 3 demandThe developing demand story for the Model 3 is critical to any thesis for owning Tesla stock. The automaker ultimately hopes deliveries for the vehicle will rise to around half a million units per year. Further, the company\'s forecast that its total vehicle deliveries will rise about 55% in fiscal 2019 is highly dependent on a huge increase in Model 3 sales.Fortunately, production, deliveries, and demand for the vehicle all remain strong.In Q1, Tesla produced a record 62,950 Model 3 units -- up from 61,394 units in the fourth quarter or 2018. Tesla\'s 50,900 Model 3 deliveries were below the 63,150 delivered in Q4, but the bulk of Tesla\'s 10,600 vehicles in transit to customers at the end of the Q1 were Model 3 units; the automaker only had 1,010 Model 3 units in transit to customers at the end of Q4 2018.Further, Tesla said U.S. orders for Model 3 ""significantly outpaced what we were able to deliver in Q1."" While the company offered no details about overseas orders for the vehicle, they\'re apparently good enough for Tesla to reaffirm its impressive guidance for 360,000 to 400,000 total vehicle deliveries in 2019 -- a range that would be 45% to 65% higher than the 2018 number.Zooming outWhile it\'s easy to focus on the sequential decrease in Tesla\'s Model 3 deliveries, investors should be wary of getting too caught up in quarter-to-quarter fluctuations. Since Tesla doesn\'t advertise, it\'s likely to take some time for its\xa0word-of-mouth marketing strategy\xa0to build sales momentum. That was the\xa0 case with Tesla\'s Model S, too, as trailing-12-month sales steadily rose during the time between the vehicle\'s launch in 2012 to an annualized sales volume of around 50,000 units by the end of 2015 -- a level where it has mostly remained (give or take around 5,000 units in any given trailing-12-month period) ever since.""As more people see our car on the road, take a test drive or talk with another Model S owner, more demand is created for our product,"" Tesla said regarding its low-key marketing tactics in its Q3 2013 shareholder letter.Further, when zooming out from quarter-to-quarter fluctuations in Tesla\'s total vehicle deliveries, they\'re notably soaring on a year-over-year basis. Deliveries were up 110% in Q1. In addition, deliveries are up 158% year over year on a trailing-12-month basis. One quarter of worse-than-expected deliveries, therefore, isn\'t enough to justify worrying about Tesla\'s sales growth potential.Considering that the Model 3 is already the best-selling mid-sized premium sedan in North America, Tesla\'s update on U.S. demand for the vehicle suggests it is a big hit with consumers -- and it bodes well for the company\'s\xa0overseas expansion, which has only just begun.This article originally appeared in the Motley Fool.Daniel Sparks\xa0owns shares of Tesla.

Not only will it give investors insight into how the company\'s important Model 3 production-ramp up and\xa0global expansion\xa0initiatives are faring, but the automaker sometimes uses the update to reveal other views into its business. For instance, in the past, Tesla has talked about demand, vehicle order trends, and even forecasts for order trends.Going into Tesla\'s first-quarter vehicle delivery update next week, investors should look not just for the number of vehicles delivered but also for an update on order trends for the Model 3. Is demand on the upswing after the launch of Tesla\'s\xa0long-awaited $35,000 Model 3?Whether or not the release of Tesla\'s most affordable vehicle helped demand or not may be the most important thing to look for in electric-car maker\'s update.Why it mattersEver since Tesla\xa0garnered around 400,000 reservations\xa0for the Model 3 within a few months of its initial unveiling, the company has had high expectations for the vehicle\'s sales potential. Management\'s big expectations are best summed up in comments from CEO Elon Musk in the company\'s\xa0most recent earnings call: ""[M]y best guess for demand of Model 3 worldwide is something -- in a strong economy, it\'s something on the order of 700,000 or 800,000 units a year. ... But I think even in a recession, worldwide demand is still something in the order of 500,000 for Model 3.""Tesla\'s recent quarterly delivery volumes bode well for the Model 3\'s potential. The company averaged about 60,000 quarterly Model 3 deliveries in its last two quarters. This was notably before introducing the lower-cost $35,000 version of the Model 3 and before expanding to Europe and Asia.But Tesla still hasn\'t proved it can generate annual demand for Model 3 at volumes above 500,000 per year.Investors, therefore, should look for Tesla to explain how the introduction of the $35,000 Model 3 and the company\'s expansion to new markets has impacted demand for the important vehicle.\xa0If Tesla says that the launch of the lower-cost Model 3 and its global expansion are driving a significant increase in order volumes, then Musk\'s optimistic outlook for Model 3\'s demand potential will be more believable.Reasons to worryThe electric-car maker has given investors some reasons to doubt whether demand for the vehicle is living up to management\'s expectations. For instance, before the standard-battery $35,000 Model 3 was launched, pricier versions of the vehicle were hit with\xa0several price cuts. Further, Tesla recently brought back a revised version of its referral program.Of course, it\'s always possible that Tesla has simply been able to ramp-up Model 3 production at a faster rate than expected, prompting the company to pull a few demand levers.Hopefully, we\'ll have a better idea next week whether investors should worry about demand.This article originally appeared in The Motley Fool.Daniel Sparks\xa0owns shares of Tesla.

https://www.ibtimes.com/next-3-electric-bmws-sneak-peak-2781057,The Next 3 Electric BMWs: A Sneak Peak,John Rosevear,03/29/19,3:03 AM,"['German luxury-vehicle maker\xa0BMW AG\xa0(NASDAQOTH:BAMXF) (NASDAQOTH:BMWYY)\xa0recently released photos showing three of its upcoming electric vehicles undergoing extreme cold-weather testing in northern Sweden, inside the Arctic Circle.This isn\'t just a tease. BMW has been\xa0talking about\xa0its\xa0electric-vehicle plans\xa0for years, but now it\'s\xa0putting California upstart\xa0Tesla\xa0(NASDAQ:TSLA)\xa0-- and its own global rivals -- on notice: BMW\'s upcoming electric vehicles are real products, not ""vaporware""; the new electric BMWs are being developed to meet the company\'s traditionally high standards; and they\'re coming to market over the next two years.Here\'s a look at what we know about the three upcoming electric BMWs, and how they fit into the automaker\'s overall future-tech strategy.BMW iX3BMW\'s X3, a compact luxury crossover SUV, is one of its best-selling products around the world. This all-electric version, called the iX3, will go into production next year. BMW said it will have a rated range of over 400 kilometers (248 miles) on the new, stricter WLTP European test cycle, and the ability to use DC fast-charging stations with capacity of up to 150 kilowatts.BMW will offer the iX3 in markets around the world. But in an interesting twist, all iX3s will be built in China, at a Shenyang factory owned by BMW\'s joint venture with Chinese automakerBrilliance Auto\xa0(NASDAQOTH:BCAUF). That plan should help lower BMW\'s costs, making the iX3 more affordable, more profitable, or both.BMW i4The photos released by BMW suggest that the i4 is a fairly traditional-looking BMW sedan -- and that means it\'s aimed squarely at Tesla\'s Model 3. Like the iX3, the i4 will use what BMW calls its ""fifth-generation"" electric-drive technology -- but with enhanced performance.For starters, it\'ll have a bigger battery pack than the iX3. BMW said that the i4 will have a WLTP-rated range of over 600 kilometers (372 miles), and that it will accelerate from 0 to 100 kilometers per hour (62 mph) in 4 seconds, with a top speed of over 200 kilometers per hour (124 mph). But unlike the iX3, it won\'t be built in China: The i4 will go into production at BMW\'s factory in Munich, Germany, in 2021.BMW iNEXTBMW has been throwing around the ""iNEXT"" model name for the last few years, while promising production -- of\xa0something\xa0-- in 2021. Originally conceived as a futuristic self-driving sedan, the iNEXT has evolved into a big electric luxury SUV that will incorporate BMW\'s latest not-quite-self-driving system when it goes into production in 2021.BMW describes the iNEXT as its ""technology flagship."" It said the vehicle will ""combine the latest innovations in ... design, automated driving, connectivity, electrification and services."" That said, it\'ll use the same fifth-generation electric-drive technology as the i4 and iX3, with WLTP-rated range of over 600 kilometers.And the self-driving? BMW is now saying that the iNEXT is ""designed for Level 3 automated driving."" Level 3\xa0isn\'t full self-driving; it\'s a somewhat more robust version of the best driver-assist systems (like Tesla\'s Autopilot and\xa0General Motors\' Super Cruise) available right now.BMW will begin producing the iNEXT SUV at its factory in Dingolfing, Germany, in 2021.For BMW, this is still the beginningAs with most of the big global automakers, the electric vehicles that BMW will launch over the next two years are just the beginning. BMW has said that it will have a total of\xa012 battery-electric models by 2025, ranging from a lower-priced successor to the small i3 (reportedly under 30,000 euros, or about $33,700) to big luxury models like the iNEXT.Why is it taking so long? It\'s not that BMW is stymied by electric-vehicle technology. It\'s that the supply chain needed to support the millions of electric vehicles that BMW and its global rivals plan to produce every year is still being created. As suppliers of lithium and batteries and motor parts ramp up, costs will come down -- and more electric vehicles will come to market.In the near term, BMW is spending heavily to help make all of that happen. The company acknowledged last week that its spending on electric vehicles and other advanced technologies will\xa0squeeze its margins in the near term\xa0-- but the expectation is that it will all pay off as these vehicles come to market over the next few years.This article originally appeared in the Motley Fool.John Rosevear\xa0owns shares of GM.

https://www.ibtimes.com/why-ford-reshuffled-its-electric-vehicle-plans-2780483,Why Ford Reshuffled Its Electric-Vehicle Plans,John Rosevear,03/27/19,9:45 PM,"['Ford Motor Company\xa0(NYSE:F)\xa0said that it will spend at least $900 million between now and 2023 as it prepares to build electric and autonomous vehicles at two sites in Michigan.Ford\'s plan is a revamp of a previous one to expand a factory in Michigan to build future-tech products, including a self-driving vehicle. But this announcement isn\'t just inside baseball: It\'s a signal that Ford is scaling up its near-term efforts for electric vehicles.That makes it important to Ford investors. Here\'s what we know.A new plan for Ford\'s Mustang factoryBack in early 2017, Ford said that it planned to\xa0expand an existing factory\xa0in Flat Rock, Michigan, to build two new advanced-technology vehicles: a\xa0self-driving vehicle\xa0that will have a gasoline-electric hybrid drivetrain, and a new all-electric SUV. (The Flat Rock factory currently builds the Ford Mustang and Lincoln Continental.)That plan has since been revised. Ford now says that it will spend around $850 million to expand and revamp the Flat Rock plant to build its\xa0upcoming new generation of battery-electric vehicles(but\xa0not\xa0the self-driving vehicle). Part of that investment will also fund the tooling needed to build the next-generation Mustang.Wait. Does this mean the Mustang is going electric?Nope. While Ford has confirmed that a hybrid version of the Mustang is on the way, it isn\'t abandoning internal combustion for its iconic muscle car. The Mustang will be built on its own assembly line, separate from the new electric Fords.(This news does, however, call into question the future of the Lincoln Continental: Will there be a next-generation Continental, and if so, might it be electric? Ford isn\'t saying.)But what about that self-driving Ford?Ford said it will build a new facility for its upcoming self-driving commercial vehicle. That facility will install self-driving systems in ""purpose-built, commercial-grade hybrid vehicles"" built by Ford elsewhere, the company said. (It isn\'t clear where.)Production of the self-driving Ford is still set to begin in 2021, in line with the old plan.Isn\'t there a battery-electric Ford SUV coming next year?Yes, but it won\'t be built at Flat Rock. The vehicle that Ford has described as a\xa0Mustang-inspired battery-electric performance SUV\xa0will be built at a Ford factory in Cuautitlan, Mexico, that currently builds the subcompact Ford Fiesta.Ford will begin retooling the Cuautitlan factory to build the electric SUV after Fiesta production ends in August.What does all this mean?The simple way to think about it is that Ford is preparing two North American factories to build battery-electric vehicles at scale. It\'s also building a new facility to assemble the self-driving commercial vehicle it has promised for 2021.But there\'s a bigger-picture takeaway here as well. It seems as though investors have been listening to the big automakers talk about electric vehicles and self-driving capabilities for years now. But unless you were privy to the discussions and investments happening behind the scenes, it seemed like just talk, like the automakers had no substantive answer to\xa0Tesla\xa0(NASDAQ:TSLA)and other new entrants into their space.But Ford\'s investment, and those of several other global automakers, finally provides clear evidence that the talk hasn\'t been just talk. When automakers deploy capital on this scale, it means that those new products really are on the way.This article originally appeared in The Motley Fool.John Rosevear\xa0owns shares of Ford.

https://www.ibtimes.com/teslas-meandering-energy-strategy-still-killing-solar-2777466,Tesla's Meandering Energy Strategy Is Still Killing Solar,Travis Hoium,03/20/19,12:18 AM,"[""When\xa0Tesla\xa0(NASDAQ:TSLA)\xa0bought SolarCity for $2.6 billion in 2016, it was supposed to create an energy powerhouse that could drive the future of renewable energy. People could buy solar, energy storage, and an electric vehicle under one roof and have a fully integrated energy solution. Cutting ties from the grid couldn't be far off.Less than three years after the acquisition closed, Tesla's solar business is a shell of its former self and\xa0continues to lose ground. And it appears solar will continue to be an afterthought as Tesla tries to steady its vehicle business.Tesla's meandering solar sales strategyWhen Elon Musk announced in late February that Tesla would be closing most of its retail locations (a move that was later reversed) it was a shock to people observing the auto business,\xa0but it should have been even more shocking on the energy side of the business. One\xa0of the arguments Musk made for buying SolarCity was that he\xa0could move sales into Tesla showrooms\xa0and pair more auto sales with solar and energy storage, leveraging the product ecosystem and retail infrastructure to increase sales and lower costs. To that end, Tesla shut down door-to-door sales that accounted for most of SolarCity's sales and moved solar into some showrooms. The strategy hasn't been successful so far, with solar installations dropping like a rock, but Musk continued to argue that solar would eventually turn the corner and that showrooms were key to solar's growth.During the fourth-quarter\xa02018 earnings announcement, Musk said:We deployed 73 MW of retrofit solar systems in Q4, a 21% decrease sequentially. We are still in the process of transitioning our sales channel from former partners to our Tesla stores and training our sales team to sell solar systems in addition to vehicles.Less than a month later, that argument died when retail closures were announced, even though the closures may not ever happen. Tesla clearly doesn't have a strategy for selling solar energy, and it's become a total afterthought to the business.What in the world is Tesla doing with energy?Tesla could be one of the most innovative companies in energy if it put some effort into it. It has a large solar manufacturing facility in Buffalo, NY (that reports indicate are largely unused) and innovative products like the solar roof and Powerwall. But it doesn't have much traction with either product in the market, and it doesn't have a clear sales or manufacturing strategy.As Tesla struggles, more focused competitors like\xa0Sunrun\xa0and\xa0SunPower\xa0are expanding their capabilities and increasing market share in the U.S. Both now have their own energy storage products that pair with solar systems, which is what Tesla said it was going to do with SolarCity.Tesla was never really an energy companyAs much as it may have made sense on the surface for Tesla and SolarCity to combine, Tesla never really took energy seriously. When push came to shove, the auto business was always going to win out, and that makes it tough to grow and innovate in an industry as competitive as solar energy.At the end of the day, Tesla's meandering energy strategy will likely be what dooms its solar business. Retail solar was the future just a few months ago, only to be put on the chopping block with no clear replacement. How are workers or customers supposed to take Tesla Energy seriously when Tesla itself doesn't appear to take solar seriously? That's a question Elon Musk has to answer before I would consider spending tens of thousands of dollars to put Tesla's energy products in my home, and by the look of Tesla's solar decline, other customers have the same reservations.This article originally appeared in the Motley Fool.Travis Hoium\xa0owns shares of SunPower.

https://www.ibtimes.com/model-y-could-save-tesla-or-destroy-it-2776834,The Model Y Could Save Tesla -- Or Destroy It,Adam Levine-Weinberg,03/18/19,9:19 PM,"[""At first glance,\xa0Tesla\xa0(NASDAQ:TSLA)\xa0might seem to be on a roll. The electric vehicle pioneer posted a huge jump in deliveries last year, as production of its Model 3 sedan ramped up. Yet there have been\xa0growing signs of trouble\xa0at Tesla in the past few months. Most significantly, the Model 3 order backlog appears to be shrinking quickly, as evidenced by a drop in wait times for new orders and the recent introduction of the long-awaited $35,000 base model.Against that backdrop, Tesla unveiled its next new model last week: the Model Y crossover. The Model Y will be Tesla's first foray into the compact/midsize crossover space, the hottest segment in the auto market. Thus, the vehicle could become extremely popular. However, it won't be available for at least a year and a half -- and now that car buyers know it's coming, Tesla could struggle to sell the vehicles it is building today.The Model Y could be quite popularTesla CEO Elon Musk expects the Model Y to be the company's best-selling vehicle. Most analysts agree. In recent years, sales of sedans and hatchbacks have plunged in the U.S. and most of the world, as more car buyers have opted for the greater comfort and cargo space offered by crossovers and SUVs.Thus far, Tesla's results don't fully fit this trend. In recent quarters, global deliveries of Tesla's Model S sedan and Model X SUV have been roughly equal.That said, the Model S is extremely large. It even has optional rear-facing seats suitable for two children, nominally allowing it to seat seven people. By contrast, buyers who are comparing the Model Y to the smaller Model 3 sedan may opt for the crossover in far greater numbers, to take advantage of its extra space. That creates a potentially serious near-term problem for Tesla.Will Model 3 sales hold up?The Model Y will have a starting price of $39,000, just $4,000 more than the Model 3. And while Model 3 prices have been a moving target recently, it appears that upgraded versions of the Model Y will cost about 10% more than comparable versions of the Model 3.That's a modest premium for a vehicle that has at least 50% more cargo space -- and can seat seven in a pinch, for buyers who pay an extra $3,000 for a third row. This raises the question of whether the Model Y will cannibalize demand for the Model 3.Musk doesn't seem to think so. On Tesla's fourth-quarter earnings call, he estimated that steady-state global demand for the Model 3 would be around\xa0700,000 to 800,000 units a year\xa0in a strong economy. With Tesla only expecting to build around 300,000 Model 3s this year, Musk's comments imply that capacity -- not demand -- would be the main constraint on sales, at least until Tesla's new factory in China gets up and running.That said, Musk's confidence doesn't seem to be founded on actual order activity. During the earnings call, he mentioned that January and February tend to be slow months for auto sales. He also noted that the phase-out schedule for federal electric vehicle tax credits pulled some demand forward into late 2018. Thus, Musk expected Model 3 sales to rebound around now.The Model Y announcement could cause many would-be Model 3 buyers to reconsider which Tesla is right for them. In the short term, the continuing availability of a $3,750 federal tax credit (through June) may bolster demand in the U.S. But based on the apparent slowdown in Model 3 orders in recent months, Tesla's current Model 3 production rate appears to be unsustainable.Navigating perilous watersTesla ended 2018 with $3.7 billion of unrestricted cash. However, the company expected to burn cash in the first quarter, due to the timing and mix of deliveries. Furthermore, it recently repaid $920 million of convertible notes with cash.Thus, Tesla's cash cushion has shrunk significantly since the beginning of 2019. Management hasn't been worried because it has been confident that Tesla would produce positive free cash flow for the rest of the year. But between the federal tax credit falling by 50% again at midyear, the introduction of the low-margin $35,000 Model 3, and a potential need to offset slumping demand with price cuts, incentives, or production cutbacks, Tesla is likely to continue burning cash beyond this quarter.If the Model Y launch creates a significant air pocket in Model 3 demand, Tesla could face a cash crunch. Depending on how much cash it ends up burning, the company could have trouble raising capital if it proves necessary. That could decimate Tesla stock -- even if the Model Y ultimately becomes a big success.Furthermore, a slowdown in demand this year could erode Tesla's brand halo. In the long run, that may be an even bigger threat to the company. A ton of competition is coming to the electric vehicle market, particularly in the crossover segment. If Tesla loses its cachet over the next year and a half due to falling sales, even the coming of the Model Y may not be enough to save it.This article originally appeared in The Motley Fool.Adam Levine-Weinberg\xa0has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

The vehicle was reportedly “underwhelming” to Wall Street analysts that expected more out of the introduction.Tesla stock fell about 4 percent in early morning trading, adding to the\xa0decline the shares have already recently seen. Tesla shares have lost $7.4 billion in market value in 2019, CNBC reported.Tesla entered the SUV market with its Model Y electric vehicle offering as it deals with more competition in the electric vehicle segment and pressure to increase profits while lowering prices, CNBC reported.""It\'s wild to think about, 11 years ago today we\'d made literally one car. And a year from now we\'ll have made a million,"" Tesla CEO Elon Musk said.With a price tag of $39,000 to $60,000, the Model Y is 10 percent larger than Tesla’s Model 3 midsize sedan with seven seats, panoramic glass roof, and 66 cubic feet of cargo space, according to Musk. A prototype of the vehicle was unveiled at the Tesla Design Center in Hawthorne, California, on Thursday.During the company’s shareholder\xa0meeting in June, Musk stated the first deliveries of the Model Y would be slated to begin in the first half of 2020 followed by higher priced models in fall 2020 and\xa0spring 2021 for the $39,000 version.According to the research note of Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, the Model Y could give Tesla a significant advantage. He said the market for crossovers is “massive,” which could allow the Model Y to make up 15 to 20 percent of the company’s overall unit sales.Shares of Tesla stock were down 4.87 percent as of 2:33 p.m. EST on Friday.']"
https://www.ibtimes.com/tesla-completely-out-control-2774710,Tesla Is Completely Out Of Control,Adam Levine-Weinberg,03/12/19,10:23 PM,"[""Even at the best of times,\xa0Tesla's\xa0(NASDAQ:TSLA)\xa0operations have seemed like loosely organized chaos. But while the electric-vehicle pioneer repeatedly missed deadlines, it was hard to argue with the long-term results. Tesla went from delivering a little over 22,000 vehicles in 2013 to more than 245,000 in 2018. By the end of that period, it had also reached profitability -- albeit with the help of\xa0various gimmicks\xa0to boost the mix of Model 3 sedans toward pricier (i.e., more lucrative) versions.By contrast, Tesla's recent behavior is more concerning. In particular, the company's rapid-fire price changes for its vehicles and its hastily announced -- and subsequently reversed -- decision to close most of its stores are signs of a business that has been stressed to the breaking point.Price changes continueIt's becoming difficult to count the number of times Tesla has adjusted its prices in the past six months. In October, the company launched a cheaper version of the Model 3 with a mid-range battery, at a starting price of $45,000. Less than a week later, it raised the price by $1,000.The changes have accelerated since the beginning of 2019. In January, Tesla\xa0cut the prices of all of its vehicles\xa0by $2,000 in the U.S., to partially offset the phase-out of the federal tax credit for Tesla buyers. (Around the same time, it also stopped taking orders for the smaller-battery versions of the Model S and Model X.) Tesla cut Model 3 prices by another $1,100 in early February.The biggest change came on Feb. 28, when Tesla announced that it would start taking orders for the long-awaited $35,000 version of the Model 3. At that time, it slashed the prices on all of its other models by an average of 6 percent. Some premium versions of the Model S and Model X were marked down by\xa0as much as $18,000. Yet these price cuts announced less than two weeks ago were partially reversed on Sunday. Tesla will raise prices by an average of 3 percent worldwide next week.Changing prices this frequently is virtually guaranteed to alienate customers, especially those who recently paid more for their vehicles. The frequency of these price cuts could also dampen demand, if potential customers start to expect prices to keep falling.Thus, it's hard to come up with a positive interpretation of these developments. The most likely explanation is that Tesla sales have slowed dramatically and the company is desperately casting about for ways to reverse the trend. Plunging wait times for new orders, analysts' channel checks, and data regarding sales in Europe all seem to confirm this explanation.Tesla stores are closing -- or are they?An equally bizarre reversal regarding store closures also played out in the past two weeks. In conjunction with the Feb. 28 Model 3 announcement, Tesla announced that it would close nearly all of its stores and galleries to cut costs and make it possible to offer lower prices.There was just one problem: Tesla is locked into long-term leases for most of its 106 U.S. stores. At an investor conference last week,\xa0Taubman Centers\xa0(NYSE:TCO)\xa0CEO Robert Taubman declared that Tesla would have to pay huge termination fees to back out of its leases.\xa0The Wall Street Journal\xa0reported that Tesla was on the hook for $1.6 billion of future lease payments.That number is misleading, as it includes millions of square feet of production, administration, and warehouse space. Still, the rent Tesla owes for its retail spaces is significant. For example, it has eight stores at Taubman's roughly two dozen properties, which command an average base rent of more than $60 per square foot. Including expense reimbursements and percentage rent, Taubman Centers' average rent is well over $100 per square foot -- and significantly more at the best malls, where Tesla stores are heavily concentrated. Thus, the total lease liabilities for Tesla's U.S. stores alone could easily run into the hundreds of millions of dollars.Tesla should have recognized that it couldn't just walk away from these leases, but that seems to have been the original plan, more or less. On Sunday, it reversed course, indicating that it would close 10% of its stores immediately, with another 20% under review for possible closure in the coming months. Tesla said this was why it has to raise prices by 3% next week.Sloppy decision-makingIt's hard to avoid the impression that Tesla CEO Elon Musk's frenetic leadership style is no longer working. He's not inspiring customers to order Model 3s in droves, he's not inspiring loyalty among his subordinates -- at least not\xa0in the leadership ranks\xa0-- and he's not making good business decisions, as evidenced by the fact that he keeps changing them abruptly.Maybe Musk's overloaded schedule is finally catching up to him. Maybe the SEC's scrutiny is taking a toll on him. It's hard to know. But now, what once seemed thoroughly implausible -- that Musk could be a liability to Tesla, rather than an asset -- now seems entirely possible.Until Tesla can deliver several quarters of steady results to prove that production costs and demand are both meeting expectations, investors should steer clear of Tesla stock.This article originally appeared in The Motley Fool.Adam Levine-Weinberg\xa0has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

https://www.ibtimes.com/will-feds-tell-tesla-fire-elon-musk-over-tweets-2768887,Will The Feds Tell Tesla To Fire Elon Musk Over Tweets?,John Rosevear,02/26/19,9:26 PM,"['Once again, Elon Musk is in trouble for tweets. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Monday asked a federal court judge to hold the\xa0Tesla\xa0(NASDAQ:TSLA)\xa0CEO in contempt for violating an agreement that requires him to get advance approval for Tesla-related social media posts.It might seem trivial -- who cares about a few tweets? -- but this could result in Musk\'s leaving Tesla, at least for a while. Legally speaking, Musk\'s Tesla-related tweets are considered investor communications, and it\'s not OK for a company to give forward-looking guidance that it knows it won\'t meet. Among the potential penalties: Musk could be barred from acting as CEO of Tesla (or any other public company) for a time.Here\'s what we know.Why the SEC wants a judge to hold Musk in contemptHere\'s the background: Last year, the\xa0SEC sued Musk and Tesla\xa0over Musk\'s\xa0now-famous ""funding secured"" tweet, in which he (falsely) claimed that Tesla would soon go private at $420 per share. The case was quickly settled after Musk and Tesla agreed to pay fines and\xa0accept some limitations, including a provision that required Tesla to preapprove any company-related communications from Musk that might contain material information.In a\xa0court filing\xa0on Monday, the SEC argued that Musk breached that agreement with a tweet on Feb. 19 that didn\'t follow the agreed-on preapproval process.A few hours later, after consulting with the lawyer assigned to monitor his tweets, Musk tweeted an amendment.Apparently, the amendment made the SEC suspicious. The commission contacted Musk and Tesla the next day, asking them to confirm whether Musk had complied with the preapproval procedures before posting that first tweet. After learning that he had not, the commission decided to ask the court to hold Musk in contempt.What\'s the big deal? Won\'t this just blow over?It\'s possible that Musk will receive the equivalent of a slap on the wrist -- a token fine or something. But there\'s one possible consequence that could be\xa0very\xa0significant for Tesla investors: Musk could be barred -- legally barred -- from being an officer or director of any public company for a period.That would end his tenure as CEO of Tesla, at least for a while. And given that some huge percentage of Tesla\'s sky-high valuation is about its future potential as outlined by Musk, it seems likely that a penalty that bars Musk from serving as Tesla\'s CEO (or on the company\'s board) would clobber the stock price.But how likely is it that the SEC would go that far? Wall Street analysts are skeptical. J.P. Morgan auto analyst Ryan Brinkman, who has an ""underweight"" rating on Tesla, acknowledged in a note on Tuesday morning that Musk could be removed in a ""worst-case scenario.""But Brinkman feels that this latest kerfuffle is much less serious than the allegations following Musk\'s ""funding secured"" tweet last year -- and he thinks that Tesla\'s stock won\'t implode even if Musk is forced to step away from the company for a time. ""If the SEC were to seek Mr. Musk\'s removal (perhaps subject to yet another settlement), we believe the shares may approach the mid-$200 levels,"" he wrote.Still, it\'s possible that the SEC will try to make an example of Musk, who has not only flouted the rules, but has occasionally trash-talked the commission while doing so. And the reality is that if it comes to a battle between the Feds and Tesla, Tesla isn\'t going to win.The market doesn\'t think this is a big deal yet, but\xa0that could changeSo far the broader market seems mostly unconcerned about these developments. Tesla\'s share price fell about 3% in early trading on Tuesday, but that\'s hardly a major move for what has always been a volatile stock.But it\'s worth noting that Tesla\'s general counsel, Dane Butswinkas, who had been hired after helping to negotiate last year\'s settlement with the SEC, left the company on Feb. 20, the day after these tweets. Was his departure related to Musk\'s unwillingness to follow the rules?We don\'t know yet, but we may find out -- especially if the SEC has decided to make an example of Musk.This article originally appeared in the Motley Fool.John Rosevear\xa0has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

https://www.ibtimes.com/tesla-news-model-3-leasing-wont-solve-car-makers-problems-2767737,Tesla News: Model 3 Leasing Won't Solve Car Maker's Problems,Adam Levine-Weinberg,02/24/19,11:22 AM,"[""Tesla\xa0(NASDAQ: TSLA) is preparing to extend its leasing program to the Model 3,\xa0according to Electrek. An internal Tesla document indicated that leasing could begin within two weeks, although the company later clarified that it would take longer to get the program off the ground -- perhaps a few months.The availability of leases for Tesla's most affordable vehicle could unlock incremental demand. However, Tesla won't be able to offer attractive lease options -- unless it uses aggressive assumptions about the vehicles' residual values. And if it goes the latter route, Tesla could open itself up to huge losses in the future if Model 3 resale prices come in lower than planned.Tapping A New Pool Of DemandTesla has offered leases for its Model S and Model X vehicles for years. They aren't cheap. For a Model S with a $94,000 list price, Tesla is currently offering a three-year, 36,000-mile lease in California for $8,424 down, including the first month's payment, plus $1,539 per month. That works out to more than $62,000 over three years.Despite the massive expense of leasing a Tesla, leasing accounts for\xa0a little over 20%\xa0of Model S and Model X volume. CFO Deepak Ahuja recently acknowledged that most people leasing Teslas have a small business and choose the lease option because it has tax benefits for them.Nevertheless, management believes that offering leases for the Model 3 will boost demand. That's important, because Tesla has been struggling to sell as many Model 3s as it is building -- though the wait time for California customers is down to one week or less. Yet the size of that demand boost, and the financial risk it entails, will depend on how aggressively Tesla prices the leases.Can Tesla Rely On High Residual Values?Whether it leases a vehicle directly to a customer or through a leasing partner, Tesla assumes the risk that the vehicle will depreciate more than expected over the lease term. Customers who decline the option to buy their vehicle at the end of the lease term can return it with no further obligations. Tesla then has to resell the car, and pay the cost of getting it ready for resale.In recent years, Tesla has had\xa0no trouble reselling Model S vehicles\xa0coming off lease for more than their assumed residual value. Bulls see this as proof that there's not much risk involved in Tesla's leasing program.However, residual values could plunge in the coming years. First, Tesla has only had to resell off-lease vehicles in a strong market up until now. A recession could put significant pressure on pricing. Second, in recent years, Tesla has had a waiting list for new vehicles, making used Teslas more desirable. With production surging and wait times falling, that's already changing.Third, the electric-vehicle market is about to become way more competitive, as virtually every major brand is readying electric models. The Tesla brand will almost certainly retain its cachet, but price-sensitive buyers -- i.e., the people most likely to consider used vehicles -- are also likely to check out other brands in the hope of getting a good deal. Fourth, and most importantly, Tesla has already\xa0cut Model 3 prices\xa0-- twice. With more competition hitting the market every year, the electric-vehicle tax credit phasing out, and production costs falling, Model 3 prices will likely continue to decline. Clearly, that will pressure resale values, too.Pricing will probably have to be quite highTogether, these factors may force Tesla to charge an arm and a leg for Model 3 leases relative to the cost of buying the car outright.For example, the cheapest Model 3 available today costs $42,900 -- or $44,100 after destination and document fees. But if a comparable new Model 3 could sell for $35,000 a few years from now, Tesla may have to assume that a Model 3 leased in mid-2019 will depreciate by 50% over three years. That could lead to pricing along the lines of $7,000 down, including the first month's payment, plus $650 per month after all taxes, fees, and interest -- putting the total cost at nearly $30,000 for three years: hardly affordable.Even with these onerous terms, Model 3 leases might still appeal to some small-business owners. However, the incremental demand pool would be relatively small compared with Tesla's ambitious plans to raise production.Of course, Tesla could try to juice sales by reducing the lease payment and betting on a higher residual value. If so, investors should watch out, as the company could be setting itself up for huge losses when those vehicles are returned a few years down the road.This article originally appeared in the Motley Fool.Adam Levine-Weinberg\xa0has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

All Tesla sedans sold in China are made in the United States.Media reports say Chinese social media sites confirm the spike in orders for the Tesla Model 3 all-electric sedan. Social media posts also show strong consumer demand in the Model 3, whose starting price at the start of the year stood at RMB499,000 ($72,000).In December 2018, Tesla slashed prices for its Model 3, the third cut since November. In November, Tesla cut the prices of its Model X and Model S sold in China by 12 percent to 26 percent.It seems the frenzy to order Teslas is being driven by these vehicles’ much lower prices. Tesla is also offering options to entice more buyers. Earlier this month, Tesla opted to include its Enhanced Autopilot, as standard for all Model 3 purchases in China. This add-on feature previously cost RMB46,300 yuan ($6,800).Sources said during the past few days alone, some Tesla stores encountered system issues due to the surge in orders for the Model 3. \xa0One post said “At least 20 orders per store in a day (weekdays) $TSLA #Tesla #Model3 #TeslaChina.”Another post reported that “Tesla Model 3 sales went insane the last few days in different cities of China.”One Weibo user said her sales representative’s mobile phone was receiving notifications for Model 3 orders every 6 to 10 minutes. “During the chat with the Tesla specialist, I observed that his cellphone popped three times with new Model 3 orders in about 20-30 mins. In other words, about 6-10 minutes, there is a Model 3 sold in that location.”    Visitors look at a Model X car of electric-carmaker Tesla Motors at the first China International Import Expo (CIIE). Tesla is experiencing a welcome surge of orders for its all-electric cars in China. Photo: JOHANNES EISELE/AFP/Getty Images  The frenzy surrounding Tesla’s all-electric sedans grew to such an extent some social media users posted info and photos about cargo ships loaded with the vehicles arriving in China. One post revealed that the Glovis Symphony, “a cargo ship loaded with China-bound Model 3, has arrived at the Tianjin Port.“Other ships loaded with the sedan, such as the solar-hybrid car carrier, Emerald Ace, are expected to arrive in China within the next weeks as well, as noted in a report from local news outlet CCTV. With these factors in mind, it appears that Model 3 deliveries in China would likely begin very soon.”Despite all this welcome excitement (for Tesla), there is no guarantee Tesla’s electric cars will sweep the Chinese market. This market, however, is moving solidly towards the acceptance of electric vehicles.The China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM) reported that sales of new energy vehicles such as electric cars soared 140 percent year-on-year in January to 95,700 vehicles sold.""]"

CEO Tim Cook had\xa0confirmed in 2017\xa0that the company was ""focusing on autonomous systems"" and believes self-driving software will end up being ""a core technology."" Companies that test autonomous vehicles on public roads in California are required to file disengagement reports with the state\'s Department of Motor Vehicles. A disengagement is when a safety driver takes control over the vehicle, turning off the autonomous system.The DMV released\xa0those reports this week. Here\'s what they show about Apple\'s Project Titan.Autonomous miles reached nearly 80,000For 2018, Apple test vehicles recorded\xa079,745 miles in autonomous mode, compared to just 838 miles\xa0in autonomous mode in 2017. That led to 69,510 disengagements, up from 7,074 in 2017. Apple saw a dramatic improvement in its autonomous system, given the reduction in disengagements per mile.    Autonomous System Photo: California DMV  Disengagements per mile are just one metric that can be used to gauge the safety of an autonomous system, and can only be loosely compared to other companies due to fundamental differences in how each company is approaching development, as well as how they define a disengagement.In a letter\xa0to the DMV, Apple says its ""approach to disengagements is conservative,"" and that it started to categorize disengagements ""in greater detail"" starting in July 2018. The Mac maker added a new category for ""Important Disengagements,"" which Apple defines as ""situations that might have resulted in a safety-related event or a violation of the rules of the road.""Alphabet\xa0 (NASDAQ:GOOG) \xa0 (NASDAQ:GOOGL) \xa0subsidiary Waymo has quite a lead in autonomous driving technology, having started the project a decade ago. Waymo published a\xa0blog post\xa0this week to discuss its disengagement reports, noting that its disengagements per mile fell by 50% in 2018 to one disengagement per 11,017 autonomous miles -- or a rate of 0.00009 disengagements per mile. Waymo logged 1.2 million autonomous miles in California last year, more than tripling the distance traveled autonomously in 2017.Tesla\xa0 (NASDAQ:TSLA) , another major player in the development of semi-autonomous and autonomous vehicles, does not test vehicles on public roads in California. Instead, the electric-car maker develops its technology using simulation, test tracks, and public roads outside of California. Tesla simulates autonomous driving in the background in customer vehicles, which the company refers to as ""shadow mode."" The company says\xa0its customer fleet has driven over 1 billion miles using its Autopilot semi-autonomous driving system. Autopilot, while always controversial, came under renewed scrutiny last week after third-party researcher Quality Control Systems disputed\xa0Tesla\'s claim that Autosteer reduced collisions by 40% after securing the underlying data through a Freedom of Information Act request.Research and development expenses are on the riseApple\'s R&D expenses have been steadily climbing over the past five years, as the company continues to push deeper into new product categories like wearables and\xa0bring the development of core technologies in-house. Developing proprietary chips is incredibly expensive, as is working on autonomous vehicle technology.    DATA SOURCE: SEC FILINGS. CALENDAR YEARS SHOWN.

In Tesla\'s fourth-quarter shareholder letter, management said it expects to deliver between 360,000 and 400,000 vehicles during the year. This represents 45% to 65% year-over-year growth compared to the approximately 245,500 vehicles Tesla delivered in 2018.But can investors trust management\'s guidance? After all, the company has\xa0missed key production and delivery targets\xa0in the past. Fortunately, Tesla looks like it\'s approaching its guidance conservatively this time.While achieving the midpoint of Tesla\'s guidance range for vehicle deliveries would require 55% year-over-year growth, a significant increase in the company\'s production rate wouldn\'t be needed to pull this off. The company delivered 90,966 vehicles in its fourth quarter. This translates to an annual run rate of about 364,000 vehicles -- above the low end of management\'s guidance range. Put another way, to grow annual deliveries 48% year over year, all Tesla would need to do is maintain the rate of quarterly deliveries it exited 2018 with.But is the demand there? Almost certainly. Of the 90,966 vehicles Tesla delivered in Q4, 63,359 were Model 3 -- all of which were delivered in North America. In 2019, Model 3 is expanding to Europe and China, giving demand for the vehicle a significant tailwind.Mix in Tesla\'s history of rapidly increasing vehicle production and the company\'s recent aggressive push to\xa0sell Model 3 at lower prices, and an estimate for deliveries to increase 55% year over year to 380,000 begins to sound conservative.What about the high end of Tesla\'s guidance range?For Tesla to deliver 400,000 vehicles in 2019 or -- better yet -- exceed its guidance range, the company will likely need to bring to market its promised $35,000 version of the Model 3. A $35,000 version of the vehicle, which is $7,900 less than the cheapest Model 3 version available today, would open Tesla up to a much broader customer base, easily pushing demand for the vehicle high enough for the company to hit the high end of its guidance range.Tesla says on its website it expects the lower-cost version of the car, which will feature a smaller battery than its current Model 3 variants, to be available in four to six months.But investors shouldn\'t count on this cheaper version. When asked about the promised $35,000 Model 3 on Twitter this week, Musk responded, ""We\'re doing everything we can to get there. It\'s a super hard grind.""This article originally appeared on The Motley Fool.\xa0Daniel Sparks\xa0owns shares of Tesla. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Tesla.

https://www.ibtimes.com/teslas-2019-outlook-doesnt-inspire-confidence-2759633,Tesla's 2019 Outlook Doesn't Inspire Confidence,Adam Levine-Weinberg,02/04/19,6:21 PM,"['Investors in\xa0Tesla\xa0(NASDAQ:TSLA)\xa0had a muted reaction to the electric car pioneer\'s\xa0earnings release\xa0last week. Revenue more than doubled year over year in the fourth quarter, and Tesla posted a solid profit and strong free cash flow for the second consecutive quarter. On the other hand, the company\'s adjusted earnings per share of $1.93 fell short of the average analyst estimate of $2.19.Yet the more troubling part of Tesla\'s fourth-quarter earnings report was its guidance for 2019. The company expects its recent profitability improvements to continue this year -- with the possible exception of the first quarter -- but this projection may be built on wishful thinking.What Tesla expects in the year aheadDespite its rapid revenue growth, Tesla has actually started shedding jobs recently, in an effort to operate more efficiently. It is in the midst of cutting its full-time workforce by 7%, which should reduce costs by about $400 million annually.Tesla says that these cost cuts and other efficiency gains will allow it to keep gross margin stable for the older Model S and Model X product lines in 2019 while improving Model 3 gross margin to around 25% later this year. That in turn would drive strong profitability and free cash flow in the final three quarters of 2019. (Tesla also hopes to turn a profit in the first quarter, but it faces a temporary headwind related to beginning Model 3 deliveries in Europe and China.)The path to Model 3 gross margin improvement is trickyLast quarter, Tesla delivered 61,394 Model 3s, up about 13% sequentially. Meanwhile, labor hours per vehicle declined by 20% compared to Q3 while Tesla learns how to build the Model 3 more efficiently. Nevertheless, gross margin remained flat sequentially at a little more than 20%, as Tesla introduced a somewhat cheaper mid-range model during the quarter.The pressure on Model 3 gross margin will intensify in 2019. First, Tesla cut all of its vehicles\' prices by $2,000 in the U.S. at the beginning of this year to partially offset the reduced federal tax credit available for Tesla buyers.Second, Tesla has been selectively fulfilling the highest-margin Model 3 orders thus far -- most notably by not starting production of the long-promised $35,000 base model. That strategy is not sustainable indefinitely. Tesla\'s recent pricing changes, the surprise introduction of a mid-range model, and its decision last summer to allow customers who are willing to pay for a premium version to skip the line (and thereby get a bigger tax credit) all indicate that its\xa0production is outpacing demand\xa0for the priciest versions of the Model 3.Tesla is starting deliveries to Europe and China now, which will allow it to tap into new pools of demand for the priciest Model 3s during the first half of 2019. That should temporarily buoy gross margin, offsetting Tesla\'s price cuts in the U.S. However, the company currently estimates that it will begin delivering the most affordable versions of the Model 3 in four to six months.In its 2019 outlook, Tesla admits that it is relying on ""careful management of mix"" to get to a 25% gross margin for Model 3. Yet its practice of building the most expensive models first will limit its ability to manage the Model 3. By the end of 2019, variants that cost less than $40,000 could account for the vast majority of Model 3 production by necessity. Thus, Tesla will need deep cost reductions just to hold Model 3 gross margin steady at around 20%.Model S and Model X production may fallAnother potential headwind is that Tesla may produce fewer high-margin Model S and Model X vehicles this year. Tesla recently stopped nighttime production of the Model S and Model X,\xa0according to CNBC, although some analysts believe this is because it is churning out cars at a faster rate during the daytime shifts, and the change does not represent an outright production cut.What we do know is that Tesla expects a modest year-over-year decline in combined deliveries of the Model S and Model X this quarter. Additionally, Tesla said that it expects to deliver between 360,000 and 400,000 vehicles in 2019.The low end of that range would actually be slightly below the run rate from the fourth quarter. Furthermore, Tesla plans to steadily increase Model 3 output in 2019, reaching a production rate of 7,000 per week at the Fremont factory by year-end. Taken together, these estimates strongly suggest that combined deliveries of the Model S and Model X could take a big step backward from last year\'s total of 99,394.Risks loom largeTesla remains an exciting high-growth company, with revenue expected to rise more than 30% in 2019. The opening of its first China factory in late 2019 (or perhaps early 2020) will expand its production capacity and allow it to dramatically reduce Model 3 prices in China, which should boost sales. Looking further ahead, Tesla hopes to begin volume production of the Model Y small SUV by late 2020, providing a new lever for growth.Nevertheless, Tesla is a very risky stock due to its high valuation and uncertain prospects for gross margin expansion. With federal subsidies quickly shrinking to zero in the U.S., Tesla may have more trouble selling its pricey vehicles than it currently expects. Investors should consider other growth stocks that may offer a better risk-reward trade-off.This article originally appeared in the Motley Fool.\xa0Adam Levine-Weinberg\xa0has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

In addition, management said it expects to potentially report a tiny profit in its first quarter of 2019 and to be profitable throughout the rest of the year.While some financial figures from the quarter, including the company\'s $718 million sequential increase in cash, its free cash flow of $910 million, and more were notable takeaways from the period, there were some other interesting tidbits to surface. In particular, executives used the update to provide investors insight into Tesla\'s future product plans.Here\'s a look at what Tesla said about Model Y, Tesla Semi, and its planned pickup truck.Model YModel Y will likely begin initial production early next year, said Tesla CEO Elon Musk during the company\'s fourth-quarter earnings call.\xa0But investors shouldn\'t expect to see any meaningful volume until the end of the year.Initial production of Model Y will be ""very low volume, early next year,"" Musk said.The CEO continued:But then it always takes time to ramp up any production system, and it\'s difficult to predict the shape of that S-curve. So we feel confident in saying there will be production volume of Model Y by the end of next year.Importantly, Tesla says it\'s designing Model Y to make manufacturing the vehicle more cost effective and less of a headache than previous new vehicle programs.""Since Model Y will be built on the Model 3 platform and is designed to share about 75% of its components with Model 3,"" Tesla explained in its fourth-quarter letter to shareholders, ""the cost of the Model Y production line should be substantially lower than the Model 3 line in Fremont, and the production ramp should also be faster.""Tesla SemiTesla\'s\xa0fully electric semi-truck\xa0is also scheduled to go into production next year. But Tesla\'s automotive lead Jerome Guillen wasn\'t as clear about when the company expects to reach volume production for the vehicle.""[T]he first units will be ... for our own usage,"" Guillen said. ""So, [it] depends how many trucks we\'ll use for our own usage to move the parts and the vehicles to different locations, and then we\'ll start delivering to outside customers.""A Tesla pickup truckFinally, Tesla even briefly touched on its longer-term plans to launch a pickup truck.""And then the Tesla pickup truck, we might be ready to unveil that this summer,"" Musk said. ""It will be something quite unique, unlike anything else.""While Tesla hasn\'t been clear about when it hopes to begin producing its pickup truck, it\'s likely that the vehicle won\'t go into production any earlier than 2021 since the electric-car company will need resources for the production ramp of Model Y and Tesla Semi in 2020.In the meantime, Tesla is focusing on steadily increasing Model 3 production throughout 2019. After a sharp production ramp for the vehicle in the second half of 2018, a further ramp-up in Model 3 production throughout the year is expected to help deliveries in 2019 come in 45% to 65% higher than they were in 2018, according to management.This article originally appeared in the Motley Fool.Daniel Sparks\xa0owns shares of Tesla.

The profit was achieved with the help of a triple-digit year-over-year growth rate in automotive revenue and a strong gross margin on its high-volume Model 3. The quarter capped off a pivotal year for the company in which production capacity, deliveries, and revenue soared.Here\'s a look at some of the key takeaways from the quarter.Tesla\'s fourth-quarter results: The raw numbers    Data source: Tesla 2018 fourth-quarter shareholder letter. Photo: The Motley Fool  Tesla\'s top line soared 120% year over year in the company\'s fourth quarter to $7.2 billion. This growth was primarily attributable to the company\'s ramp-up of Model 3 production and deliveries.The company\'s bottom line for the quarter was $139 million, or $0.78 on a per-share basis. This is up significantly from a loss of $4.01 in the year-ago quarter. Non-GAAP earnings per share for the period was $1.93, up from a loss per share of $3.04 in the year-ago quarter.HighlightsLooking aheadIn 2019, Tesla expects to deliver between 360,000 and 400,000 vehicles, up 45% to 65% from deliveries in 2018.

""We are planning to continue to produce Model 3 vehicles at maximum production rates throughout 2019.""In terms of the company\'s profitability, Tesla says its ""optimistic target is to achieve a very small GAAP net income in Q1,"" but it expects to be profitable on a GAAP and free-cash-flow basis beyond its first quarter.Notably, the company is also on track with its\xa0plans to pay off debt. ""In the second half of 2018, our cash position improved by $1.45 billion despite the scheduled repayment of a $230 million convertible bond in Q4,"" Tesla said.

https://www.ibtimes.com/tesla-faces-painful-dose-reality-2756450,Tesla Faces A Painful Dose Of Reality,Adam Levine-Weinberg,01/27/19,10:29 AM,"['Throughout 2017 and 2018,\xa0Tesla\xa0(NASDAQ:TSLA) posted phenomenal growth. Revenue soared from just $7 billion in 2016 to an estimated $21 billion in 2018. Vehicle deliveries grew at an even faster rate, rising from roughly 76,230 in 2016 to 245,240 last year. Tesla even\xa0turned profitable\xa0in the second half of 2018.However, in the background, warning signs about the sustainability of Tesla\'s performance have been building up. Unfortunately, CEO Elon Musk is only now acknowledging the extent of the challenges the company faces, which has created an unnecessary crisis for the electric-vehicle pioneer.Reality hits TeslaEarlier this month, Musk sent a letter to Tesla employees announcing that the company had to cut about 7% of its full-time workforce. He noted that Tesla is on track to post a second straight quarterly profit for the fourth quarter, but that it will earn less money than in Q3. Furthermore, he expects Tesla\'s earnings to continue to trend lower in the first part of 2019.The underlying problem is simple. As Musk stated in his letter (via CNBC), ""While we have made great progress, our products are still too expensive for most people."" He continued:In Q3 last year, we were able to make a 4% profit. While small by most standards, I would still consider this our first meaningful profit in the 15 years since we created Tesla. However, that was in part the result of preferentially selling higher priced Model 3 variants in North America. ... [S]tarting around May, we will need to deliver at least the mid-range Model 3 variant in all markets, as we need to reach more customers who can afford our vehicles. Moreover, we need to continue making progress toward lower priced variants of Model 3.Today, the cheapest Tesla you can buy costs $44,000 before the impact of any tax credits. For the first year or so after Model 3 sales began, the cheapest available option cost $49,000. And many customers so far have opted for even pricier variants. The higher-priced models are dramatically more profitable for Tesla than a hypothetical $35,000 Model 3 would be.As impressive as Tesla\'s Q3 surge to profitability was, it isn\'t necessarily sustainable unless the company can either dramatically reduce its manufacturing costs or permanently keep Model 3 average transaction prices above $50,000.The signs have been there to seeIn the past six months or so, it has become painfully obvious that Tesla is reaching the limits of demand for pricier Model 3 variants, at least in its main market of North America.For example, in July, the company began allowing potential customers willing to pay up for a premium version of the Model 3 to\xa0skip the line\xa0of reservation holders waiting for lower-priced variants. In October, Tesla guaranteed that all orders placed by Oct. 15 would be eligible for the full $7,500 federal electric-vehicle tax credit (which was scaled back to $3,750 for deliveries in the first half of 2019 and will phase out entirely at the end of this year) and then introduced a slightly cheaper\xa0mid-range Model 3 variant. Lastly, Tesla implemented an across-the-board\xa0$2,000 price cut\xa0in the U.S. earlier this month.In short, while there was ample pent-up demand for $50,000-plus Model 3s in 2017 and the first half of 2018, Tesla has already addressed most of that demand. Furthermore, with production ramping up, it needs to sell more cars each quarter than it did in the prior quarter. And in the U.S. -- Tesla\'s largest market -- the phaseout of the EV tax credit is another headwind.For now, Tesla has been able to avoid introducing the profit-killing $35,000 Model 3, through a combination of the tactics noted above and beginning deliveries of pricier variants outside North America. Yet that\'s only a temporary solution. At some point in 2019, Tesla will need to either reduce production or -- more likely -- make the $35,000 Model 3 available.A manufactured crisisThe auto industry is a tough business under any circumstances. Tesla faces the added pressure of being a young company with a unique business model and heavy reliance on just a few products.That said, the supposedly urgent crisis requiring Tesla to slash costs so it can reduce prices is largely self-imposed. Thanks to its phenomenal growth over the past two years, it\'s had ample opportunity to raise $5 billion, $10 billion or more through stock sales or debt issuances to support its growth. However, Musk has been bizarrely reluctant to raise capital recently.If Tesla had a big cash cushion, it could afford to steadily reduce prices -- even if doing so would lead to short-term losses -- as long as production costs were steadily declining at the same time. Instead, Tesla is trying to thread the needle of gaining scale and reducing its costs without incurring significant near-term losses.Perhaps Elon Musk can pull off another miracle. But if he had been less stubborn about raising capital in 2017 and 2018, Tesla wouldn\'t need one.This article originally appeared in The Motley Fool.Adam Levine-Weinberg\xa0has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

https://www.ibtimes.com/tesla-stock-downgraded-what-you-need-know-2755447,Tesla Stock Downgraded: What You Need to Know,Rich Smith,01/23/19,8:45 PM,"['Every day, Wall Street analysts upgrade some stocks, downgrade others, and ""initiate coverage"" on a few more. But do these analysts even know what they\'re talking about? Today, we\'re taking one high-profile Wall Street pick and putting it under the microscope...After slipping below $300 earlier this week on worries about\xa0Tesla\'s\xa0(NASDAQ:TSLA)\xa0decision to\xa0cut car prices by $2,000\xa0and\xa0lay off 7% of its workers\xa0to further reduce costs, shares of the electric-auto maker were under pressure again this morning, falling more than 2% in pre-noon trading.You can thank\xa0RBC Capital\xa0for that.Downgrading TeslaThis morning, analysts at Canadian investment bank RBC announced they are cutting Tesla stock from sector perform to underperform and dropping their target price to $245, as described in a write-up on\xa0StreetInsider.com(subscription required).The cut comes just days before Tesla is due to report Q4 earnings, which CEO Elon Musk has predicted will be profitable, but ""less"" so than the $312 million earnings quarter that Tesla reported three months ago. (How much less? Fool.com contributor Daniel Sparks is predicting a profit of\xa0between $0.80 and $1.50 per share, versus Q3\'s $1.75 in\xa0GAAP\xa0per-share earnings.)For the record, that prediction doesn\'t faze RBC overmuch. To the contrary, RBC argues that Tesla getting more ""tactful with messaging"" is in fact ""a long-term positive"" that will temper expectations (and make it easier for the company to\xa0beat\xa0expectations, I might add). On the other hand, the fact that Tesla feels the need to lower its own bar suggests we\'re now seeing ""downward pressure to growth expectations -- which in our view are too high.""High hopes, but are they too high?Why might RBC worry that expectations for Tesla are too high? Let\'s run down the list.In recent years, Musk has\xa0publicly predicted\xa0there will be demand for anywhere from 500,000 to 700,000 Model 3 sedans per year -- demand that Tesla will be able to supply. RBC, on the other hand, says ""a reasonable max\xa0Model 3\xa0production range for Tesla [is] 260[k]-312k"" units. As the analyst explains, ""[T]he $2k price cut and talk about having to lower cost further as federal tax incentives subside confirms our view that the bulk of demand is at a lower price point"" than the near-$60,000 average price\xa0of Model 3s sold last year ""that Tesla can\'t access yet profitably.""Accordingly, RBC is predicting Tesla will max out production at the 312,000-unit level.A consensus is formingNor is RBC the only analyst sounding this warning. Reuters is quoting Greenlight Capital founder\xa0David Einhorn\xa0today,\xa0warning that analysts who last year mostly worried that Tesla might suffer a ""shortage of supply"" are now starting to worry that a ""shortage of demand"" will be the company\'s bigger problem.Indeed, analysts at\xa0Needham & Co., who were\xa0already bearish on Tesla\xa0and remain so, doubled down\xa0on their underperform rating on shares today: ""Tesla has essentially exhausted its highend\xa0Model 3\xa0backlog,"" opines Needham, and ""there is a strong possibility that the company may experience difficulty getting a sufficient number of new orders in the U.S. along with ramping internationally in order to remain profitable.""(Needham also worries that the company may have trouble shifting production of battery packs over from larger, extended-range batteries to its smaller ""Standard Battery"" configuration to satisfy an uptick in demand for Model 3s with shorter ranges and lower prices.)What it means to Tesla investorsAre these valid concerns? They certainly could be.Tesla ramped up hiring and production rates last quarter, and in so doing set new records for production and deliveries -- and earned its first quarterly profit in two years\xa0(and its\xa0second\xa0quarter of positive operating cash flow in a\xa0single\xa0year, according to data from\xa0S&P Global Market Intelligence). It did this, however, by capitalizing on pent-up demand for the Model 3, and by emphasizing production and sale of the model\'s most expensive (and profitable) variants.Going forward, that\'s going to be harder to do if most of the demand for higher-trim Model 3s has now been satisfied -- which is what Tesla\'s moves to cut costs suggest here in the U.S. On the other hand, the company has just begun shipping Model 3s to Europe, where there\'s still untapped demand for the higher-trim models, and\xa0deliveries to China\xa0are slated for March. This suggests there\'s still hope for profits to continue going strong in the early part of 2019 at least.Even if Tesla reports the anticipated decline in profits for Q4, strong guidance for the quarters to come could be sufficient to keep enthusiasm for the stock buoyant through earnings -- and prove today\'s naysayers wrong.This article originally appeared in the Motley Fool.Rich Smith\xa0has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

Deliveries of the vehicle in the third and fourth quarter of last year were 55,840\xa0and 63,150\xa0units, respectively. These deliveries were up from a total of about 26,000 Model 3 deliveries in the first half of 2018.While higher Model 3 production and deliveries have helped the automaker swing to a profit, this was only accomplished by prioritizing deliveries of higher-priced Model 3 variants in North America. But the market for high-end Model 3\'s is only so big -- and there are signs Tesla is coming close to\xa0maxing out sales of pricey Model 3 variants\xa0in its current markets.Fortunately, Tesla still has more major global markets to expand to where it can try to take full advantage of pent-up demand for the vehicle before it brings to market lower-cost versions. One of these markets is Europe, where Tesla is getting ready to begin Model 3 deliveries.Expanding to EuropeNetherlands Vehicle Authority (RDW) cleared the Model 3 for deliveries in Europe,\xa0reported Bloomberg on Monday. The approval suggests the automaker is on track with its plan\xa0to expand Model 3 deliveries to the key market by February.""European Model 3s off the production line,"" Tesla said in a tweet\xa0that showed a photo of several Model 3s on Monday.Tesla is optimistic about the European market. Management noted in the company\'s third-quarter shareholder letter that the ""mid-sized premium sedan market in Europe is more than twice as big as the same segment in the US."" While this suggests there\'s meaningful upside for deliveries of Tesla\'s high-end Model 3 variants, investors should also keep in mind that the electric-car maker\'s current Model 3 delivery volumes in North America may not be sustainable until lower-cost versions are introduced. Otherwise, Tesla likely wouldn\'t be\xa0cutting the price of the vehicle.Also helping support sales of Tesla\'s current Model 3 variants, which start at $44,000 in the U.S., will be the company\'s expansion to China. In the company\'s Jan. 2 update on its quarterly vehicle production and deliveries, Tesla said it also plans to expand Model 3 deliveries to China in February.Aiming for improved economies of scaleThere\'s more to Tesla\'s overseas expansion than the higher sales it will bring for the electric-car maker. The company\'s global expansion of its higher-end Model 3 versions is part of its plan to achieve improved economies of scale so it can finally launch its promised $35,000 version, which will have a lower profit margin than high-end versions. Indeed, the effort is so important that Tesla recently announced plans to\xa0cut about 7% of its full-time employees, aiming to keep costs down as it works to finally bring the more affordable version to market.""Tesla will need to make these cuts while increasing the Model\xa03 production rate and making many manufacturing engineering improvements in the coming months,"" Musk said in a letter to employees that was posted on its blog last week. ""Higher volume and manufacturing design improvements are crucial for Tesla to achieve the economies of scale required to manufacture the standard range (220 mile), standard interior Model\xa03 at $35k and still be a viable company.""It would be difficult to overstate the importance of Tesla\'s global expansion for high-end Model 3 variants. As Musk emphasized in his letter to employees last week, ""There isn\'t any other way.""Of course, if deliveries in North America are any indication of how demand for the vehicle will play out in Europe and China, the company shouldn\'t have any problem selling the vehicle overseas.

https://www.ibtimes.com/3-investing-trends-watch-2019-2754630,3 Investing Trends To Watch In 2019,Chris Neiger,01/21/19,10:20 PM,"[""There have been a few trends that have gained steam over the past few years and are shaping up to become even bigger in 2019. For those who've been paying close attention to the technology, automotive, and healthcare industries, you've likely noticed that artificial intelligence, electric vehicles, and cannabis growing are three stock ideas that just can't seem to stay out of the headlines.Like most investment trends, betting on these trends early is better than holding off for too long. You might have to stomach some volatility as they grow, but there's no mistaking that each offers its own unique investing opportunity.Trend 1: Artificial intelligenceAI has the potential to bring truly transformative technologies to market, some of which we're already beginning to see. For example,\xa0Alphabet's\xa0(NASDAQ:GOOG)\xa0(NASDAQ:GOOGL)\xa0self-driving car company, Waymo, recently launched the\xa0first commercial autonomous ride-hailing service\xa0just last month. Waymo's technology is primarily controlled by\xa0artificial intelligence systems\xa0that process visual information from cameras and sensors to give the autonomous vehicles sight.Waymo's service is still in the early stages, but estimates have put the company's potential market value at $70 billion.Amazon\xa0(NASDAQ:AMZN)\xa0is also knee-deep in AI and already uses machine learning, a type of artificial intelligence, for the speech and image recognition services it provides through its Amazon Web Service (AWS) cloud-computing platform. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos has also\xa0highlighted the use of machine learning\xa0to improve how the company forecasts product demand, product search rankings on its website, and deal recommendations.Amazon's AI integration is an example of how businesses will implement AI over the coming years, and as they do, they'll create $3.9 trillion in global business value (including cost reductions, new revenue streams, and better user experiences) by 2022, according to\xa0Gartner. And that might just be the tip of AI's full potential. Artificial intelligence could add $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030, according to PwC.Trend 2: Electric vehiclesThis one might seem like an odd trend to highlight, but recent moves by\xa0General Motors (NYSE:GM)\xa0indicate that electric vehicles are on their way to becoming more mainstream. The company announced back in November that it was laying off some of its workers in part so that it can\xa0focus attention on making a new platform\xa0for electric vehicles (EVs).GM is expected to release the first EV on the new platform in late 2021 or early 2022, and it will eventually use it across its Cadillac, Buick, and Chevrolet brands, though its initial EV focus in the U.S. will be on Cadillac vehicles. The pivot to EVs is a big one for GM, and the move may be partially influenced by the rise of EV sales in China, which is the largest automotive market. Electric vehicle sales in the country already outpace those in the U.S.Of course, no discussion about EVs is complete without mentioning\xa0Tesla\xa0(NASDAQ:TSLA). Despite a year of controversies\xa0in 2018 involving the company's CEO Elon Musk, Tesla was able to steadily increase deliveries of its Model 3 from 1,550 in the fourth quarter of 2017 to an impressive 63,150 in the fourth quarter of 2018.The jump in Tesla Model 3 deliveries over the past year prove that the company -- and EVs in general -- are only beginning to find traction. It's worth pointing out that there's still a long road ahead for Tesla. Musk recently said that he's laying off 7% of the company's workforce while still aiming to increase Model 3 production.Over the next few years, EV sales are poised to take off. The latest estimates from J.P. Morgan show that global sales of electric vehicles will reach 8.4 million units in 2025, up from just 1 million in 2016. And with those increases, EVs will create a $567 billion market that same year.Trend 3: The cannabis industryAnd finally, one of the biggest trends many investors are watching right now is the cannabis industry. Much of the excitement around this market comes from what's happening in Canada, where the sale of marijuana to adult individuals for recreational use is now legal across the country.The opening up of the cannabis market in the country has caused the share price of the few publicly traded Canadian marijuana growers to skyrocket recently. For example, shares of\xa0Canopy Growth, Inc.\xa0(NYSE:CGC),\xa0one of the largest cannabis growers\xa0in Canada, have popped 60% over the past six months. Investors are optimistic about a\xa0$4 billion investment\xa0the company received from\xa0Constellation Brands\xa0(NYSE:STZ), one of the world's largest alcoholic beverage companies, in mid-2018. Canopy also recently made a move to begin selling\xa0hemp-based consumer goods\xa0in the U.S. that's sparked investor optimism.Another big player in marijuana stocks is\xa0Aurora Cannabis\xa0(NYSE:ACB), which is one of the\xa0top cannabis-producing companies. Aurora is benefiting from medical marijuana sales in countries around the world and has expanded its reach recently through several important acquisitions. Aurora's stock, like most marijuana stocks, remains highly volatile but has lots of potential.The worldwide legal cannabis market is\xa0expected to grow to $194 billion\xa0by 2025, and if current trends continue in the U.S., America's marijuana market will be worth $23.4 billion by 2022.How to follow these trendsIt's impossible to predict how these trends will grow, of course. But there's no denying that electric vehicles, artificial intelligence, and the cannabis industry are hot markets getting lots of attention right now.In the coming years, it's likely investors will continue to hear more about these markets as more companies use AI to improve their businesses, as EV sales continue to grab more automotive market share, and as more countries (namely, the U.S.) expand legal cannabis sales. For investors looking to benefit from some of the biggest trends available right now, each of the companies mentioned above is worth a closer look.This article\xa0originally appeared\xa0in the Motley Fool.John Mackey, CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

The cuts come as CEO Elon Musk said focus must be on delivering “at least the mid-range Model 3 variant in all markets.”\xa0In an email to employees, Musk laid out the plans for the company going forward as well as how only the “only the most critical temps and contractors” will be retained. In a\xa0tweet\xa0from October 2018, Musk revealed that the company had 45,000 employees, which suggests that over 3,000 will be cut.Musk warned employees of the volatility of the company saying, “many companies that can offer a better work-life balance, because they are larger and more mature or in industries that are not so voraciously competitive.”“Tesla will need to make these cuts while increasing the Model 3 production rate and making many manufacturing engineering improvements in the coming months,” he added.“Higher volume and manufacturing design improvements are crucial for Tesla to achieve the economies of scale required to manufacture the standard range (220 mile)\xa0standard interior Model\xa03 at $35k and still be a viable company. There isn’t any other way.”In the email to employees, Musk reported that 2018 was the most successful year to date for Tesla. The company revealed a 4 percent earnings increase, which Musk attributed to the Model 3. He said it was the best-selling premium U.S. vehicle of the year.“As we all experienced first-hand, last year was the most challenging in Tesla’s history. However, thanks to your efforts, 2018 was also the most successful year in Tesla’s history: we delivered almost as many cars as we did in all of 2017 in the last quarter alone and nearly as many cars last year as we did in all the prior years of Tesla’s existence combined!” Musk said.“Model 3 also became the best-selling premium vehicle of 2018 in the US. This is truly remarkable and something that few thought possible just a short time ago.”The job cuts are just one of a number of reductions that the company has made as of recently. Earlier this\xa0week, Tesla announced that it would be eliminating its buyer referral program because it proved to be too costly.Share of Tesla were down 12.47 percent as of 2:13 p.m. EST on Friday.']"

It managed to surpass its gross margin guidance for the Model 3 sedan by a wide margin while also clamping down on expenses. This reassured investors about the company\'s long-term earnings potential, causing Tesla stock to soar.However, Tesla threw a wrench into that rosy narrative last week. Not only did its fourth-quarter delivery total come in slightly below analysts\' expectations, but the company also announced a $2,000 price cut for all of its models in the U.S. This move raises new worries about how much demand there is for Tesla\'s pricey vehicles.A disconcerting updateTesla delivered 90,700 vehicles last quarter -- a new record for the company -- including 63,150 Model 3s. Production was slightly lower at 86,555 vehicles, with the discrepancy driven by the large number of Model 3s that were in transit to customers at the end of the third quarter.While the headline numbers were not too shabby, Tesla\'s production growth is starting to slow. Model 3 production rose 15% sequentially, after nearly doubling sequentially a quarter earlier.More surprisingly, Tesla announced that it is ""taking steps to partially absorb the reduction of the federal EV tax credit,"" which fell from $7,500 previously to $3,750 for Teslas purchased in the first half of 2019. (The tax credit will be phased out entirely for Tesla at the end of this year.) On Jan. 2, it slashed the prices of all its vehicles by $2,000 in the U.S. -- effectively absorbing more than half of the lost tax credit.What is Tesla up to?In recent years, management has frequently noted that the company has achieved its strong growth with no marketing spending and no discounts. The implication has always been that once it had sufficient production capacity, Tesla could potentially drive sales even higher by promoting its vehicles.The $2,000 price cut is effectively a discount on all of Tesla\'s vehicles. If there were abundant demand for its products, the company shouldn\'t have needed to shoulder any of the burden from the tax credit phaseout. This move will lead to hundreds of millions of dollars of lost profit this year (compared to selling the exact same vehicles for an extra $2,000 each). Given that Tesla has ambitious plans to expand production and add new models to its lineup, the automaker certainly could use the money.In its sales release, Tesla pointed to ""significant opportunities to continue to grow Model 3 sales by expanding to international markets, introducing lower-priced variants and offering leasing."" That only makes it more puzzling that the company is cutting prices in its home market.Part of the answer may be that it is more profitable for Tesla to mark down the prices of the vehicles it is currently selling than to introduce the long-promised $35,000 version of the Model 3. After all, the cheapest version of the Model 3 currently on offer still costs $44,000 after this price cut. The extra $9,000 more than covers the incremental costs of the larger battery and premium interior.This would be just the latest tactic to\xa0boost sales of pricier Model 3 variants. Still, this doesn\'t completely explain the price cut. If Tesla could fill its production capacity at full price with a combination of international sales and leases, why didn\'t it just go that route?Tesla\'s future may lie beyond the U.S.In the decade since Tesla began operations, the U.S. has accounted for more than half of its sales. The company was even more reliant on it last year, as it hasn\'t started selling the Model 3 in most international markets yet.However, the recent price cut is a sign that Model 3 demand in the U.S. isn\'t sufficient to support Tesla\'s lofty ambitions. (Of course, there will be a surge of sales when the $35,000 version becomes available, but the electric car pioneer can\'t afford to lean too heavily on its lowest-margin vehicle to drive sales volume.) Tesla is only building the Model 3 at half of its targeted production rate of 500,000 per year and it is still struggling to drum up demand at the Model 3\'s current price point.The good news is that Tesla is about to dramatically expand international availability of the Model 3. Furthermore, it just broke ground on its first factory in China, a move that will dramatically improve its competitiveness in the world\'s largest electric-vehicle market.Investors shouldn\'t panic over Tesla\'s recent price cut in the U.S. But it may be a sign that the automaker needs to put more emphasis on international markets for its future growth.This article originally appeared in the Motley Fool.Adam Levine-Weinberg\xa0has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

Indeed, Tesla\'s record fourth-quarter vehicle deliveries put total 2018 deliveries at more than 245,000 units -- up from 103,000 last year.This article originally appeared in The Motley Fool.What\'s particularly notable about Tesla\'s recent growth is that the automaker is now growing at a faster rate than it has been in more than four years. Put another way, Tesla\'s growth rate is accelerating even as the company gets bigger. This impressive trend highlights how integral Tesla\'s Model 3 production ramp-up is for the company.Accelerating growthIt\'s no secret that Tesla has grown rapidly in a very short time. Indeed, Tesla didn\'t even start selling its Model S until 2012.\xa0The important vehicle took Tesla from selling fewer than a thousand Roadsters a year to more than 20,000 Model S units per year by the end of 2013. Since then, Tesla started selling the Model X in 2015 and the Model 3 in 2017. Now Tesla is delivering more than 90,000 vehicles per quarter.As the company becomes larger, it\'s tempting to assume the electric-car maker is growing at a slower rate than in previous years. But this hasn\'t been the case. Helped by surging Model 3 production and deliveries, Tesla\'s growth rate has been reaccelerating recently. In 2018, Tesla\'s vehicle deliveries more than doubled, rising 138% year over year to more than 245,000. The last time Tesla\'s trailing-12-month deliveries saw growth this sharp was in the first quarter of 2014, when the automaker was benefiting from the recent introduction of its Model S.

Consider how Tesla articulates its recent growth in its fourth-quarter vehicle delivery update: ""To put our growth into perspective, we delivered almost as many vehicles in 2018 as we did in all prior years combined.""Expect more wild growthTesla\'s impressive trend of accelerating growth should continue. Even if total vehicle deliveries in Q1 remained at Q4 levels, TTM vehicle deliveries ending March 31 would be up 183% year over year. Of course, quarterly Model 3 production and deliveries will likely rise throughout 2019.\xa0With Tesla planning a further increase in its Model 3 production and an expansion of the vehicle\'s deliveries to markets outside of North America this year, there\'s significant runway for higher Model 3 sales.The company\'s ability to grow at a faster rate recently bodes well for Tesla\'s vehicle production prowess.

The all-new ES6 is an upscale, five-passenger SUV that should help NIO build on the early success of its first model, the larger ES8 SUV.This article originally appeared in The Motley FoolHere's what we know.About the all-new NIO ES6NIO's first SUV, the ES8, made it clear that the company is inspired by (and aiming at)\xa0Tesla\xa0(NASDAQ:TSLA). The all-new ES6 doesn't compete directly with any current Tesla model, but it's another riff on the idea of a high-performing upscale electric vehicle.The ES6 comes standard with dual motors, with an interesting twist. The front motor is a permanent-magnet unit, delivering high efficiency; the rear motor is an induction design, delivering higher performance. The idea is that, when operating together, the two motors will give the ES6 both brisk acceleration and good range.Of course, the range and acceleration specifics vary depending on how the ES6 is configured. Two battery packs will be offered, in two ES6 models. In top configuration, with an 84 kilowatt-hour (kWh) battery, the ES6 will accelerate from 0 to 100 kilometers per hour (62 mph) in 4.7 seconds and have 510 kilometers of range (about 316 miles) per the generous NEDC test standard.Inside, the ES6 appears to be nicely trimmed, with leather and upscale metal accents. There's a large (11.3 inches) touchscreen and an updated version of NIO's voice-activated AI assistant, called NOMI. The ES6 seats five people in two rows.NIO has priced the ES6 competitively, a step down from the larger ES8. The top-of-the-line ES6 starts at the same price, 448,000 yuan, as the base-model ES8 -- a price roughly half of what Tesla charges for the base 75D version of its Model X SUV.    Photo: DATA SOURCE: NIO, INC.  The ES6 should help NIO build on its early successSo far, NIO's ramp-up is on track. Deliveries of the larger ES6 have ramped up more or less smoothly since production began at the end of June. NIO's chief financial officer, Louis Hsieh,\xa0confirmed earlier this month\xa0that the company is on track to meet its full-year goal of 10,000 ES8 deliveries.    Photo: DATA SOURCE: NIO, INC  While production and deliveries have ramped up in line with expectations, the company isn't yet profitable. NIO posted an\xa0operating loss of $409.1 million in the third quarter\xa0-- but note that it shipped just 3,268 vehicles in the quarter, generating revenue of $214 million.The company's\xa0initial public offering, in September, raised about $1 billion. Assuming sales continue to grow as expected, NIO should have enough cash to make it to profitability without additional capital raises -- assuming that the ES6 is a success, of course.On paper, at least, the ES6 looks likely to do well.

Not only did Tesla's overall vehicle deliveries surge 221% year over year during the quarter, but the company also swung to a profit and racked up $881 million in free cash flow.\xa0Following a period of significant cash burn, it's difficult to overstate how crucial these results were.This article originally appeared in the Motley Fool.And the company wants to follow its third quarter with more of the same. Management said in its third-quarter shareholder letter that it expects Q4 to feature profitability and a further increase in Model 3 deliveries. As Tesla's fourth quarter nears its end, the company is revealing its tactics to finish strong.The end-of-the-year pushTesla's aggressive efforts to boost fourth-quarter sales started ramping up last month, when CEO Elon Musk said the company had secured contracts with truck haulers and had\xa0even purchased some trucking companies\xa0to avoid the logistics challenges it faced in Q3. This move, Musk said, would allow U.S. customers who order a Tesla by Nov. 30 to take delivery before the end of the year.Then Tesla said on\xa0Twitter\xa0earlier this month that it had vehicles in its inventory available for immediate delivery in the U.S.In a move to further increase deliveries, Tesla said yesterday that it would open 11 new U.S. stores during the week, extending the company's retail footprint.Finally, Musk said today that customers can even join a cancellation waiting list for a delivery this year. In addition, he said Tesla will give customers a full refund if the vehicle can't be delivered before Jan. 1.End-of-the-year deliveries are important to both Tesla and its customers. The federal tax credit for Tesla buyers is set to be halved on Jan. 1, falling from $7,500 to $3,750.Big goalsIt's no surprise that Tesla's making a big push to boost sales. While the company didn't specify how many Model 3 vehicles it expects to sell in Q4, it did say it expected both production and deliveries to increase. This implies more than 56,065 Model 3 deliveries during the quarter, putting combined Model 3 deliveries for the last two quarters well above the company's\xa0total\xa0vehicle deliveries in 2017 of about 103,000 units.In addition, it is hoping that high-volume Model 3 deliveries will help the company achieve another quarter of profitability and positive cash flow.

To them, Musk is more akin to a snake-oil salesman of old, too often failing to deliver on his outlandish promises.Both sides saw their respective stances reinforced in 2018, as Tesla\'s stock gave longs and shorts alike a wild ride (and a lot of heartburn).Even by Tesla\'s standards, it was a wild year, one in which Musk\'s antics somewhat overshadowed the genuine progress made by the company as it ramped up production of its popular Model 3 sedan.""Funding secured"" and the drama that followedLet\'s start with the big story, which began with this tweet in August:Musk\'s tweet that he was going to take the automaker private at $420 per share was a bolt from the blue that\xa0sent Tesla\'s shares soaring. In the days that followed, however, it became clear that the ""funding"" to take Tesla private wasn\'t quite as ""secured"" as Musk had suggested.In fact, it eventually came out that Musk\'s tweet was a surprise not only to Tesla\'s board of directors, but also to officials at the\xa0Saudi Arabian sovereign-wealth fund\xa0that Musk had apparently hoped would provide the funding. Seventeen days after his initial tweet, Musk conceded that\xa0Tesla wouldn\'t be going private after all.The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)\xa0sued Musk and Tesla, alleging that his initial tweet and his statements in the following days amounted to securities fraud. The case was settled, but at a cost: Musk and Tesla each agreed to\xa0pay $20 million in fines, Musk had to step down as Tesla\'s chairman for three years, and the company agreed to a series of corporate-governance changes.

It expects to deliver even more Model 3s in the fourth quarter.Meanwhile, deliveries of Tesla\'s older and more expensive models, the Model S sedan and Model X SUV, have remained steady at around 25,000 combined per quarter. Tesla expects that pace to continue through the remainder of 2018.Having apparently cleared much of the demand backlog in the United States, Tesla has started taking European orders for the Model 3. While the big Model S and Model X haven\'t sold all that well in Europe, the Model 3 might, given that its smaller size could make it a better fit for European roads.Will 2019 be the year that Tesla finally gets past all this?After this roller coaster year, a question remains: Is Tesla finally past the ""start-up"" stage? There are still concerns. The company\xa0doesn\'t have a lot of cash, and it has some big debt repayments coming due, including one in the first quarter of 2019. There are worries about the quality of Model 3s as well, with problems including frozen door handles suggesting that Tesla might have skimped on cold-weather testing in its rush to get the vehicle into production.But if Musk can stay focused and listen to Tesla\'s manufacturing experts, if the global economy remains reasonably strong, and if the Trump administration doesn\'t throw any new tariff wrenches into the works, 2019 might be the year Tesla finally gets past its perpetual-crisis mode.John Rosevear\xa0has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

On top of that, the mainstream automakers are drawing inspiration from Tesla as they design their own electric vehicles for the mass market.Several new electric vehicles broke cover for the first time at last month\'s Los Angeles International Auto Show. Here\'s a closer look at them.A German Tesla fighter: Audi e-tron GTIf there\'s one vehicle on this list that could fairly be called a Tesla-fighter,\xa0Audi\'s hot e-tron GT is it. Looking a lot like a souped-up Audi A7, the e-tron GT appears to borrow quite a bit under the skin from its corporate sibling, the\xa0upcoming Porsche Taycan\xa0-- and it looks to be aimed squarely at Tesla\'s Model S.Audi said the e-tron GT\'s dual motors put down a total of 590 horsepower, enabling a 0-to-100 kilometers-per-hour time (or 0-62 mph) of 3.5 seconds. The company claimed over 249 miles of range using the new, stricter European WLTP standard and said that it could be recharged to 80% in just 20 minutes with its 800-volt charging system, one of the elements borrowed from Porsche.How big is the battery? Audi said it\'s rated at over 90 kilowatt-hours but didn\'t give specifics.Officially, the Audi e-tron GT is a ""concept,"" a show car. But Audi said that something very much like it will go into production in about two years, following the\xa0just-launched e-tron SUV\xa0and the upcoming\xa0e-tron Sportback.American-made brawn: Rivian\'s wild electric pickup and SUVThe surprise of last week\'s Lost Angeles International Auto Show was Rivian, a Michigan-based startup that\'s preparing to bring two innovative electric vehicles to market: a pickup truck, the R1T; and a brawny, off-road-ready SUV called the R1S.Both vehicles are based on what Rivian calls its ""skateboard"" platform, which combines motors, batteries, suspension, and cooling in an integrated, low-slung package. The Rivians have\xa0fourelectric motors, one at each wheel, to maximize off-road ability and on-road acceleration. These are quick trucks: Rivian promises a 0-to-60 mph time of just three seconds.The R1T and R1S will be offered with three battery-pack options, giving range of about 230, 300, or 400 miles in the pickup. The SUV will have a bit more range at each tier, Rivian says. Pricing starts at $69,000 for the pickup and $72,500 for the SUV, before federal and state electric-vehicle incentives. Both are expected to go into production by the end of 2020 at Rivian\'s factory in Illinois.A little electric Kia with surprising specsAs expected,\xa0Kia Motors\xa0(NASDAQOTH:KIMTF)\xa0showed off an all-new version of its small Soul crossover in Los Angeles. It also showed off the all-new 2020 Soul EV, an all-electric version of the little urban runabout with surprisingly strong specifications.The all-new Soul EV will come standard with a 64-kWh battery driving a single electric motor with 201 horsepower and 291 foot-pounds of torque, enough to make the little Kia a fun, zippy driver.

We\'ve seen several of them, including the so-called I.D. BUZZ, a minivan that riffs on the iconic VW Microbus of the 1960s.But we hadn\'t seen this until last week. The Volkswagen I.D. BUZZ CARGO (yes, in capital letters) is an I.D. BUZZ revamped as a commercial vehicle. VW said it could come to market in Europe as early as 2022, when the\xa0regular I.D. BUZZ is set to make its debut\xa0-- and it added a few more details about what to expect from the I.D. line as a whole.Specifically, VW said the I.D. BUZZ CARGO will have a range of between 200 and 340 miles on the WLTP test cycle, depending on which battery pack is selected. A 48 kWh battery pack will give about 200 miles of range, sufficient for an urban delivery vehicle -- but if more is needed, there will be larger batteries available up to 111 kWh. VW also said the 111 kWh battery can be charged to 80% capacity in 30 minutes with a 150 kilowatt DC Fast charger.The van itself isn\'t really big news, of course. It\'s been clear for a while that VW wants to sell more commercial vehicles -- in fact, its partnership with\xa0Ford Motor Company\xa0(NYSE:F), announced earlier this year, is\xa0centered on commercial vehicles\xa0-- so it\'s no surprise that VW will have an electric commercial-vehicle entry. But the details about the available battery sizes are noteworthy clues as to how VW will structure its I.D. lineup when it begins coming to market next year.John Rosevear\xa0owns shares of Ford.

But after enduring some setbacks and falling behind production targets earlier this year, the company is reportedly finishing 2018 on a much brighter note than it\xa0started.This article\xa0originally appeared\xa0in the Motley Fool.Tesla has achieved a production rate for Model 3 of 1,000 units a day, according to a report from Tesla-focused blog\xa0Electrek\xa0that cites an email from Tesla CEO Elon Musk to employees. This new production rate, if sustained for seven days, would mark a meaningful uptick in the company\'s production rate of 5,300 Model 3s per week achieved at the end of Q3.1,000 units per dayImportantly, Tesla is focused on sustaining this higher level of production.""If you are able to help in any way with getting Model 3 production to a steady 1000 per day at excellent quality, everyone at the company should please consider this their top priority,"" Musk said in the email.In the past, Tesla has struggled to sustain new milestone production levels for the Model 3. For instance, even though the company finished its second quarter producing 5,000 Model 3s per week,\xa0it averaged a lesser rate of 4,300 Model 3s per week in Q3 when excluding planned shutdowns for factory upgrades.\xa0It\'s no surprise, therefore, that Tesla is intently focused on sustaining this new production level this time around.Bringing the Model 3\'s cost downBy sustaining a higher level of production, Tesla will be able to achieve greater economies of scale and make progress toward finally bringing to market its promised $35,000 Model 3 with a smaller battery, Musk added in the email:It\'s important to bear in mind that the cost of the car is made up of about 10,000 unique parts and processes. Depending on how you count it, the current cost of a standard range Model 3 would be around $38,000, so each part or process step only costs around $3.80. That means finding cost efficiencies is a game of pennies, even though it might not seem so.Initially, the Model 3 had a starting price of $49,000. But the company recently released a cheaper variant with a midrange battery capable of 260 miles of driving on a full charge -- compared with 310 miles for Tesla\'s long-range version -- with a starting price of $46,000.While a $46,000 version of Model 3 is still $11,000 higher than the promised base model Tesla has said it would bring to market, this midrange version allowed the company to lower the Model 3\'s starting price earlier than expected.""Better-than-expected Model 3 cost reduction is allowing us to bring more affordable options to the market sooner,"" management said in the company\'s third-quarter shareholder letter.Tesla is aiming to bring the $35,000 version of the Model 3 to market by the end of May, Musk said in the company\'s\xa0third-quarter earnings call. But he said Tesla wants the vehicle\'s cost of goods sold to be around $30,000 or slightly lower to produce the vehicle at volume.Daniel Sparks\xa0owns shares of Tesla.

On a non-GAAP\xa0basis, Tesla earned $2.90 per share, crushing a consensus analyst estimate for non-GAAP EPS of just $0.17.\xa0GAAP earnings and free cash flow for the period were impressive, too. The company\'s sudden profitability comes as Model 3 deliveries are surging.This article originally appeared in The Motley Fool.But given Tesla\'s long track record of losses and the capital-intensive nature of the automotive business, some investors may believe the company\'s days of profitability are numbered. Can Tesla report another quarter of profits and positive free cash flow?Achieving ProfitabilityTesla\'s third quarter benefited from a period of extraordinary growth, which ultimately led to better-than-expected profitability as the automaker achieved improved economies of scale.The company\'s revenue surged 129% year over year thanks primarily to sharp growth in Model 3 deliveries, which soared more than 200% sequentially to over 56,000 units. That figure dwarfed combined Model S and X deliveries during the period: about 28,000 units.Tesla\'s GAAP and non-GAAP net income for the quarter came in at $312 million and $512 million, respectively. Even more impressive, Tesla\'s free cash flow was $881 million, aided by $1.4 billion in operating cash flow.It was an outstanding quarter, to say the least.Sustaining ProfitabilityAn overview of Tesla\'s third-quarter shareholder letter suggests the company is positioned to report another quarter of profitability.For instance, Tesla expects its Model 3 production and deliveries in Q4 to be even higher than they were in Q3. Combining this forecast with management\'s expectation for Model 3 gross margin to remain stable during the quarter, higher unit sales should ultimately lead to a greater gross profit contribution from the Model 3.On the other hand, there are some factors that management expects to weigh on profitability in Q4, but they aren\'t expected to have a big impact. For instance, Tesla forecasts Model S and X gross margin to be slightly lower, and operating expenses to be slightly higher in Q4 versus Q3.As for Tesla\'s free cash flow, management\'s forecast is for more than a $200 million sequential increase in capital expenditures. This means free cash flow will likely still be positive, but lower than it was in Q3.It\'s worth noting that management explicitly guided for another quarter of profitability in Q4. ""We reaffirm our prior guidance that we expect to again achieve positive GAAP net income in Q4,"" Tesla\'s third-quarter shareholder letter said. ""Similarly, in Q4, we continue to expect to generate positive cash from operating cash flows net of capital expenditures, as well as the normal inflow of cash received from nonrecourse financing activities on leased vehicles and solar products.""While management has been\xa0overly optimistic with some forecasts in the past, it doesn\'t look like this will be the case this time. Indeed, even analysts are on board. On average, they expect Tesla to report non-GAAP EPS of $2.01, up from a loss per share of $3.04 in the fourth quarter of 2017.Daniel Sparks\xa0owns shares of Tesla.

The agency has the ability to press criminal charges.“We have not received a subpoena, a request for testimony, or any other formal process, and there have been no additional document requests about this from the Department of Justice for months,” the spokesperson said in an email.The Federal Bureau of Investigation is examining whether Tesla misstated information about the production of its Model 3 sedans and misled investors about its business going back to early 2017, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing sources.In recent weeks, FBI agents have contacted former Tesla employees to seek testimony in the criminal case, according to the report. The ex-employees received subpoenas earlier in the probe, and FBI agents recently have sought to interview a number of them, the sources said.Any focus on Tesla’s past statements about Model 3 production targets would broaden the probe by the agency, which Tesla said last month was looking at statements made by Chief Executive Elon Musk about a go-private deal that was later called off.Tesla first disclosed in September that the DoJ was investigating Musk’s tweets about having “funding secured” for a deal to take Tesla private, saying the agency had asked for documents about such statements.Any expansion of the FBI’s probe comes as Musk faces pressure to deliver consistent production of the Model 3 at a profit. The company on Wednesday posted a profit and positive cash flow, making good on pledges made by Musk earlier this year, as the company ramps up volume of its new sedan.MODEL 3 CHALLENGESTesla and Musk already face a proposed class action shareholder lawsuit claiming that the company and its top executives made false statements about the readiness of the Model 3 for volume production.The car, which the money-losing company is banking on to turn a profit, was introduced to the public in early 2016 to great fanfare, with repeated promises throughout 2017 that Tesla was “on track” to build 5,000 Model 3s per week by the end of that year at its factory in Fremont, California.Such statements were fraudulent, according to the lawsuit, given that the automated assembly lines to build the car in such volume were behind schedule.Tesla has denied the claims in the lawsuit, saying it disclosed production bottlenecks once they were identified, and citing Musk’s public statements that the company was undergoing a period of “production hell” in 2017.Tesla only reached a goal to build 5,000 Model 3s per week in June, although current production has fallen short of that.Musk and Tesla only recently settled with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission over Musk’s Aug. 7 tweets.

However, a few days ago, it notified would-be buyers that all orders placed by Oct. 15 would be delivered by year-end, making them eligible for the full $7,500 federal electric vehicle tax credit, which will start to phase out for Tesla purchases in January.This article originally appeared in The Motley Fool.\xa0This is just the latest move by Tesla to pump up sales of its most expensive Model 3 variants -- and of the even pricier Model S sedan and Model X SUV. It also adds to the evidence that Tesla simply\xa0cannot afford to sell Model 3s for $35,000, the advertised starting price.Boosting average selling prices has been a priority Tesla delivered its first Model 3 in mid-2017. To keep production as simple as possible, it only built rear-wheel-drive models with the long-range battery for the first year or so. That variant has a starting price of $49,000 (before options and any applicable tax credits).A few months ago, Tesla began producing dual-motor all-wheel-drive versions of the Model 3, which are even pricier. This was part of a deliberate strategy to shift production to the most expensive -- and thus most profitable -- variants. (Indeed, Tesla reported earlier this month that more than half of the Model 3s produced during Q3 were dual-motor versions.)However, many reservation holders may not be able to afford even the cheapest Model 3 variant currently in production. While there are hundreds of thousands of outstanding reservations, Tesla has been allowing\xa0nonreservation holders\xa0to order the Model 3 versions currently in production (essentially skipping the line) since July. Nevertheless, the lead time has shrunk to a maximum of four weeks for rear-wheel-drive models and eight weeks for dual-motor models.A new sales tactic  Last week, Tesla rolled out its latest ploy to generate orders for the more expensive versions of the Model 3. The electric-vehicle maker stated that it would guarantee delivery by the end of 2018 for all orders placed by Oct. 15. That's critically important, because the federal tax credit available for Tesla purchases will fall from $7,500 to $3,750 on Jan. 1, 2019, before declining again to $1,875 on July 1, 2019 and phasing out entirely at the end of next year.In effect, Tesla just told potential customers that they need to order ASAP to get the biggest possible discount. However, they must choose between options starting at $49,000 (before the tax credit).Adding to the intrigue, Tesla appears likely to start deliveries outside of North America in early 2019. It will probably spend most of the first half of next year fulfilling demand for the higher-priced Model 3 variants outside of the U.S. and Canada. As a result, the $35,000 base model probably won't become available (in the U.S. or anywhere else) until the spring of 2019.As a result, many U.S. reservation holders who are waiting for cheaper versions of the Model 3 may not even get the $3,750 tax credit that will be available during the first half of 2019. They will more likely get the $1,875 credit that will apply to Tesla vehicles delivered in the second half of next year.Thus, there's a big incentive for U.S. reservation holders to place an order now, as they won't save nearly as much money as they may have expected by waiting for Tesla to begin building cheaper Model 3s. It also means that the most price-sensitive reservation holders may not be able to afford a Model 3 after all, as the post-tax-credit price could be $5,625 higher than originally advertised.Survival could be at stake Pulling in more orders for the priciest Model 3 variants is of the utmost importance for Tesla. The company had $2.2 billion of unrestricted cash and equivalents at the end of June, after having burned nearly $2 billion of cash in the first half of 2018. Furthermore, it has about $1 billion of debt coming due over the next six months.Tesla has stated that free cash flow will be positive in the second half of 2018, which would allow it to pay off its debt maturities. (It would also make it easier to refinance.) However, that forecast is presumably based on selling a super-premium mix of Model 3s.By frontloading production of the most expensive Model 3 variants, Tesla may be able to avoid a near-term liquidity crisis. But within a few quarters, the company is likely to have exhausted demand for the priciest Model 3s. As production shifts to the $35,000 base model over the course of 2019, free cash flow could turn sharply negative again.Meanwhile, the phaseout of federal tax credits will cut into demand in the U.S. -- Tesla's largest market -- making the company's goal of building 10,000 Model 3s per month unsustainable. With lower production volume, Tesla may never achieve the economies of scale that could help it turn a profit on $35,000 cars. Thus, unless Tesla can bring costs down rapidly, shareholders may face a rude awakening in 2019.Adam Levine-Weinberg\xa0has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

His tweet came hours after a federal judge ordered him and the regulator to justify their settlement.“Just want to (sic) that the Shortseller Enrichment Commission is doing incredible work,” Musk, a frequent critic of investors betting against the electric car company said in the tweet. “And the name change is so on point!”In its quarterly letter, Greenlight said on Friday its short position on Tesla was its second-biggest winner in the third quarter. The hedge fund said Musk has been deceptive and the carmaker’s woes resemble those of Lehman Brothers before its collapse.Tesla shares plunged last week after the SEC accused Musk, 47, of fraud over “false and misleading” tweets on Aug. 7 that promised to take Tesla private and said funding had been secured.The lawsuit threatened Tesla and Musk with a long fight that could have undermined the company’s operations and ability to raise capital.In the settlement announced over the weekend, Tesla and Musk agreed to pay $20 million each to the regulator while Musk, also a large Tesla shareholder, would step down as chairman but continue as CEO.The settlement provided for the appointment of a new chairman and directors, as well as moves to oversee Musk’s output on social media.Peter Haveles, a partner in the Trial and Dispute Resolution Practice Group, said Musk’s tweets showed his lack of self-discipline and puts intense pressure on Tesla board.Several Twitter users also criticized Musk, who has over 20 million followers on the social media platform, for his tweets targeting regulators and short sellers.“I have lost 30 years of my life savings all in $tsla thanks to your tweets please stop,” TrendTrader007 wrote.“If you continue this self destructive path you will lose all your ardent supporters and the goodwill from diehard $tsla longs like me,” the user tweeted.Teresa Goody, a former SEC attorney and CEO of The Goody Group, said Musk’s “contempt for the SEC is sending a message that he has no regard for the securities laws that are intended to protect investors and ensure a fair and efficient marketplace.”In a separate tweet, Musk took another shot at shortsellers and accused BlackRock Inc (BLK.N) of enabling them by saying, “The big funds can & will (sic), as they’re suffering a net loss. Index managers like Blackrock pocket (sic) make excessive profit from short lending while pretending to charge low rates for ‘passive’ index tracking.”Widely seen as the driving force behind the company, Musk’s talent for promotion has helped Tesla vault much bigger manufacturing operations like General Motors (GM.N) and Ford (F.N) to become America’s most valuable car company.As news on the settlement emerged at the weekend, he told employees in an email that Palo Alto, California-based Tesla was “very close to achieving profitability.”Production numbers on Tuesday showed the company finally meeting its promises on output of the Model 3 sedan seen as crucial for the its long-term prospects, while also fighting hard to overcome logistical issues with deliveries.Shares of the company, down around 14 percent this year but still up almost 30 percent since the start of 2017, were last down 6.9 percent at $262.63.ReutersReporting by Akanksha Rana in Bengaluru; additional reporting by Katanga Johnson in Washington D.C.; Editing by Patrick Graham, Arun Koyyur and David Gregorio']"

The electric car manufacturer had actually recouped some of its previous losses after the settlement,  going up 17 percent at one point on Monday.By Friday, much of those gains had been erased, at least partially thanks to Musk’s SEC tweet. Musk’s tweets and their effects on the company’s share price is actually central to the issue at hand. In August, the  CEO tweeted that he wanted to take the company private at $420 per share, claiming he had secured funding for what would have been a massive undertaking.The company’s share price skyrocketed to such a degree that day that trading was actually briefly halted. Soon after, the SEC began a probe to determine if what Musk did actually constituted fraud or market manipulation. The federal agency found enough of a case to file a lawsuit against Tesla, claiming that investors were hurt by Musk’s  false claim that he had secured funding to go private.Instead of dragging the issue to court, Musk agreed to the aforementioned settlement not long after being sued by the SEC. Still, Thursday’s tweet demonstrated that Musk fundamentally disagrees with the SEC’s actions.The tech billionaire has been at the center of multiple Twitter scandals in 2018. Earlier this year, he made an unsubstantiated\xa0claim that a British cave diver was a “child rapist” after the diver was involved in the rescue of a Thai youth soccer team.

Nissan’s ProPilot Assist was ranked third and Volvo’s Pilot Assist fourth.Consumer Reports said it has been testing partially automated driving systems for several years but elected to conduct a formal study intended for publication, because “we are at a tipping point where they are now going mainstream,” according to Jake Fisher, director of auto testing.The organization said its tests, conducted on a private track and on public roads in Connecticut, were designed to measure the systems’ ability to automatically control steering and speed in certain situations, while helping drivers pay attention and regain manual control of the vehicle when required.The systems typically use cameras, radar and other sensors, as well as mapping data, to monitor location and traffic conditions and help keep a vehicle centered in the lane at a safe distance behind other cars.Each system has limitations. Cadillac\'s Super Cruise, for instance, only functions on divided highways that have been mapped by GM. In contrast, Tesla\'s Autopilot can be used even on small, curvy roads with poor lane markings, but ""operates erratically in those situations,"" Consumer Reports said.While they can help relieve driver stress and fatigue, Consumer Reports said, the partially automated systems are “not intended to be self-driving features.”The organization tested Super Cruise on the Cadillac CT6; Autopilot on the Tesla Model 3, Model X and Model S; ProPilot Assist on the Nissan Leaf and Infiniti QX50, and Pilot Assist on the Volvo XC40 and XC60.Consumer Reports said Cadillac’s Super Cruise did “the best job of balancing high-tech capabilities with ensuring the car is operated safely and the driver is paying attention.”Tesla’s Autopilot was cited for its capability and ease of use, while Nissan’s ProPilot Assist did a better job than Autopilot or Volvo’s Pilot Assist in keeping drivers engaged.Cadillac\'s Super Cruise is not related to the GM Cruise self-driving vehicle being jointly developed by General Motors and Honda Motor Co Ltd (7267.T).(Reporting by Paul Lienert in Detroit; Editing by Steve Orlofsky)-Reuters']"

https://www.ibtimes.com/electric-cars-cast-growing-shadow-profits-2721414,Electric Cars Cast Growing Shadow On Profits,Laurence Frost,10/01/18,11:01 AM,"['PARIS\xa0- Electric cars are poised to arrive en masse in European showrooms after years of hyped concept-car launches and billions in investment by automakers and suppliers.Now comes the hard part: selling them at a profit.Battery models making their car-show debut in Paris this week, from PSA Group’s (PEUP.PA) electric DS3 Crossback to the Mercedes (DAIGn.DE) EQC, will erode profitability as they struggle to stay in the black, executives generally acknowledge.But concerns are mounting that the impact could be worse, as consumers resist paying more for electrified vehicles - forcing carmakers to sell them at a bigger loss to meet emissions goals.“What everyone needs to realize is that clean mobility is like organic food – it’s more expensive,” said Carlos Tavares, chief executive of Peugeot, Citroen and Opel manufacturer PSA.A Sept. 25 profit warning by BMW (BMWG.DE), blamed in part on electrification costs and tightening emissions rules, was “a first alarm signal”, Tavares said in a weekend radio interview.“Either we accept paying more for clean mobility, or we put the European auto industry in jeopardy.”Underlining the turbulence facing automakers, British Prime Minister Theresa May will confront Conservative rebels demanding a harder Brexit stance at her party’s annual conference, just as the Paris show gets underway on Tuesday.On its second day, the European Parliament votes on plans to cut carbon dioxide car emissions by as much as 45 percent by 2030 from an average 95 grammes per kilometer in 2021 - a goal many automakers are already in danger of missing, on pain of fines running to hundreds of millions of euros.After declining for a decade, new-vehicle carbon emissions are rising again as customers flock from cars to SUVs, and from diesel to gasoline engines. Diesels emit more nitrogen oxides and particulates, but less CO2.Early signs suggest electric-car prices may fall sooner and faster than production costs, as carmakers adjust for stalled emissions progress and weak consumer appetite. That promises more red ink, as discounted battery car sales finally take off.Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) has said the ID hatchback, due to open the brand’s electric onslaught next year, will be priced close to conventionally powered versions of the Golf compact.“VW is about to launch a load of electric vehicles at the same price as gasolines, and therefore at a loss,” said Laurent Petizon, a managing director at consulting firm AlixPartners.“Our interpretation is that the 2021 fines have already been factored into their sales strategy,” he said. “Rather than pay penalties they prefer to lose money on vehicles and get the market going.”Volkswagen declined to discuss pricing in detail. “We want our electric cars to be a real alternative to a reasonably equipped Golf Diesel,” a spokesman said.Volkswagen and Mercedes parent Daimler, which between them have announced 30 billion euros ($35 billion) in electrification investment, both warned last month that it would not be enough.They and other carmakers are also mandated to sell more electric cars in China and a group of U.S. states led by California. More than 200 electric and plug-in model launches are already scheduled globally over the next three years.Electric cars still cost 7,800 euros more to produce on average than conventional ones, AlixPartners calculates. Plug-in hybrids - which combine a smaller rechargeable battery with a combustion engine - overshoot by 5,000 euros.When that cost gap is reflected in the price, few are sold.Mass-market electrics such as the Renault (RENA.PA) Zoe and Nissan (7201.T) Leaf have been on sale for most of the current decade, and heavily subsidized in Europe, while Tesla (TSLA.O) has made inroads into the premium business. Yet pure-electric cars claim just 1 percent of the market overall.Despite their higher cost, BMW plug-in models are already priced broadly on a par with diesels. The luxury carmaker acknowledges that their margins are significantly thinner.Mercedes also says the EQC electric SUV will be priced close to its GLC cousin to tackle Tesla’s $49,000 Model 3.“It absolutely is impacting the profitability of the industry,” said Rebecca Lindland, a senior analyst at Kelley Blue Book, which tracks vehicle pricing. “Demand doesn’t justify investment at all - it’s all regulation.”Which is why, on this subject more than most, European carmakers talk from both sides of their mouths. While executives exude confidence for investors’ and customers’ benefit, their Brussels lobby group ACEA warns of an imminent threat to the region’s 3.4 million automotive manufacturing jobs.“The conditions for such a systemic change clearly aren’t met, and consumers just aren’t ready for full-electric,” ACEA Secretary General Erik Jonnaert said recently.Carmakers are demanding increased public investment in recharging networks - which may yet awaken mass demand.Economies of scale should also bring some relief. But lithium-ion batteries, which claim 40 percent of an electric car’s value, face global cobalt and nickel shortages that will pull the other way, inflating costs as production volumes rise.Perhaps more critically, generous government sales subsidies are unlikely to survive much growth. In markets where incentives have been dropped, electric car sales have fallen.Renault is discounting its recently upgraded Zoe in the UK market with a 5,000 pound ($6,500) trade-in bonus, in addition to the government’s 4,500 pound plug-in incentive.French rival PSA will price its new rechargeable hybrids to match diesel leasing rates, program director Olivier Salvat told reporters on a recent factory visit - adding that the carmaker aimed to avoid losing money on each vehicle sold.“We don’t launch vehicles with negative operating margins,” Salvat said.German luxury carmakers including Volkswagen Group, which includes Audi and Porsche, could put up with losses on electrified vehicles if it enables them to keep selling their biggest earners, upscale SUVs and large sedans.That would leave mid-market competitors such as PSA and Renault, which can ill afford to sell large volumes of electric cars below cost, in a tougher bind.“In electromobility you have to be a cost leader,” BMW research and development chief Klaus Froehlich told Reuters.“If you are not a cost leader you will not survive.”($1 = 0.7675 pounds)ReutersReporting by Laurence Frost; Additional reporting by Esha Vaish in Stockholm, Gilles Guillaume and Joe White in Paris, Edward Taylor in Frankfurt; Editing by Mark Potter']"

Short sellers notched $1.27 billion Thursday alone in paper profits, according to S3 Partners, which said Tesla recently regained the title of most-shorted U.S. stock.The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) accused Musk on Thursday of tweeting false and misleading information in August about financing for his now-abandoned plan to take the company private, and said it was seeking to remove him as an officer or director.The billionaire entrepreneur said he had done nothing wrong and the company’s board said it supported him.The Wall Street Journal on Friday, citing a person familiar with the matter, reported that Musk believed he had a verbal deal for financing from Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund to take Tesla private.Musk last month in a blog said he left a July 31 meeting with the fund’s managing director “with no question that a deal with the Saudi sovereign fund could be closed.”The SEC in its suit said the meeting between Musk and the fund “lacked discussion of even the most fundamental terms of a proposed going private transaction.”Musk, 47, walked away at the last minute from a settlement with the SEC that would have required him to give up key leadership roles at the company for two years and pay a nominal fine, according to reports on Friday.But sources, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly, told Reuters that while Musk was ready to go to trial he could still settle. They did not discuss possible terms.CNBC reported that Musk had turned down an SEC deal to give up his role as chairman, while Fox Business Network reported that Musk had been offered a temporary ban as CEO.Aeisha Mastagni, a portfolio manager for the California State Teachers’ Retirement System, a Tesla investor, said she was concerned about the board’s ability to oversee Musk and the company and that she would welcome changes to Tesla’s board.“I think this board is insular, ripe with conflicts; it’s the poster child for bad corporate governance,” she said.The board also lacks a director who could take over for Musk, said investment adviser Cornerstone Capital’s research chief, John Wilson. “The problem for investors is that an investment in Tesla is an investment in Elon Musk,” he said.Musk has hired Stephen Best at Brown Rudnick, who successfully defended internet billionaire Mark Cuban in an insider trading case, according to people familiar with the plans who also asked not to be identified. He also hired former Assistant U.S. Attorney Chris Clark of Latham & Watkins to defend him in the case, the people said.Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The SEC declined to comment on the settlement reports.One person with knowledge of the SEC’s thinking said on Friday that the SEC civil lawsuit or a potential settlement did not preclude further action by the Justice Department, which has a higher standard of proof to make a criminal case.The Justice Department declined to comment.In a previous fraud case over blood-testing firm Theranos, the Justice Department brought criminal charges three months after the SEC announced its settlement with the company’s founder Elizabeth Holmes.“The SEC wouldn’t delay its case for the DOJ,” said Teresa Goody, CEO of law firm Goody Counsel and a former SEC attorney.UNCERTAIN FUTUREAt least five research firms said Musk might have to resign following the SEC lawsuit.“I think it was a big mistake to turn down the settlement offer,” CFRA analyst Garrett Nelson said.Some analysts said the SEC’s action was the beginning of a legal battle with authorities, short-sellers and other investors over Musk’s actions that could cost Tesla heavily.Musk has driven the company to the verge of profitability with a costly ramp-up of production of its Model 3 sedan over the past year.Electric vehicle news site Electrek reported that Tesla had produced 51,000 Model 3s with a couple of days left in the quarter, hitting its goal of 50,000 to 55,000 Model 3s.“The bottom line is, what he did was stupid, it was wrong, I don’t think he’s going to be thrown out,” said a large Tesla investor, who asked not to be identified due to sensitivity of the situation.“My guess is he’ll pay a big fine. I wouldn’t be surprised if as a settlement to the SEC he drops his chair of the board” role.Ihor Dusaniwsky, head of research at financial analytics firm S3 Partners, said in an email that he had seen several hundred thousand shares of new short selling in Tesla.Short interest in Tesla shares totals nearly $10.2 billion, with more than 33.1 million shares sold short, roughly 26 percent of its float, he said.Shares fell 13.9 percent to $264.77, wiping about $7 billion off Tesla’s market value.The SEC’s lawsuit, filed in Manhattan federal court, caps a tumultuous two months set in motion on Aug. 7 when Musk told his more than 22 million Twitter followers that he might take Tesla private at $420 per share, with “funding secured.”The regulator charged that Musk “knew or was reckless in not knowing” that his tweets were false and misleading.ReutersReporting by Munsif Vengattil, Sonam Rai and Vibhuti Sharma in Bengaluru; Michelle Price and Jan Wolfe in Washington; Ross Kerber in Boston; writing by Peter Henderson; editing by Meredith Mazzilli and Tom Brown']"

That figure will represent 26% of all new vehicles sold globally that year, and will be a massive increase from the 51,000 self-driving cars that are expected to be sold in 2021.And with the explosion of driverless-vehicle sales will come considerable benefits to the public. Autonomous vehicles are expected to save 300,000 lives in the U.S. each decade because the cars will be much safer and crash less often than human drivers.This article originally appeared in The Motley Fool.These vehicles are also expected to generate huge revenues for some automakers and technology companies: They\'re expected to create a massive\xa0$7 trillion passenger economy\xa0as new delivery and ride-hailing services sprout up around the self-driving vehicle market.But despite these opportunities, there are a handful of reasons why driverless vehicles may fail to live up to some of these expectations, or at least take a little while longer to achieve them. For the sake of argument -- and to try to form a more well-rounded investing thesis for this market -- let\'s look at a few pitfalls for autonomous vehicles.Federal safety regulations are minimalRight now, driverless-vehicle permits are handed out mainly by individual states, as well as cities. This system works fine for the testing stages of driverless vehicles, but the U.S lacks a clear federal approach to this technology.It\'s true that\xa0members of Congress have met\xa0to discuss driverless cars, and that the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration (NHTSA) has released\xa0guidelines\xa0for autonomous vehicles. But there aren\'t any well-defined safety regulations yet. The lack of federal laws means that there\'s currently a hodgepodge of state laws regulating these vehicles, and this could be problematic in the coming years. Some states require a human to be in the driver\'s seat while autonomous vehicles are operating, and some don\'t; others say there must be a gas pedal, steering wheel, and brakes in the car, while other states have no such requirements.Minimal federal oversight has helped spur driverless-vehicle innovation in the short term, but in the years to come, it could do more harm than good for companies and the public to not establish clear safety standards for these vehicles. Without well-defined federal safety regulations, automakers and tech companies are left to make the final call on whether their technology is safe enough for the roads, and\xa0not all companies have the same standards.There\'s a lack of clear responsibilityAnother problem facing automakers and technology companies building this tech is that there\'s no clear standard for who is responsible when a driverless car crashes. Consider the fatal 2016 crash involving a\xa0Tesla\xa0(NASDAQ:TSLA) Model S and a semitruck. The car was in Tesla\'s driver assistance mode, which the company calls Autopilot, and technology on the vehicle failed to recognize a semitruck as it crossed into the path of the Model S. Additionally, the driver ignored warnings from the vehicle to take control of the vehicle before the crash.Following the crash, a key supplier of some semiautonomous technology for early versions of Autopilot, Mobileye,\xa0ended its partnership with Tesla. Neither company publicly blamed the other for the crash, but Tesla CEO Elon Musk made comments that weren\'t complimentary to Mobileye following the accident.""Mobileye\'s ability to evolve its technology is unfortunately negatively affected by having to support hundreds of models from legacy auto companies, resulting in a very high engineering drag coefficient,"" Musk said.Similarly, Mobileye said that it cut ties with Tesla following the crash because the automaker was ""pushing the envelope in terms of safety.""This was just one incident involving two companies that parted ways following a semiautonomous-vehicle crash, but we\'re likely to see more instances like this as more of these vehicles come onto the road.The public is still very skepticalA\xa0survey\xa0released early this year showed that a whopping 64% of Americans are skeptical about being on the road with fully self-driving vehicles. The Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety survey found that 31% of drivers were ""very concerned"" about sharing the road with self-driving tech and 33% were at least ""somewhat concerned.""Other surveys of American drivers have yielded similar results. Gallup released its own\xa0autonomous-vehicle survey\xa0results just a few months ago. It asked: ""Which of the following do you think would be the safest option on U.S. roads?"" -- to which 47% of American drivers responded that ""all human-operated"" or ""mostly human-operated"" vehicles are the safest.It\'s worth pointing out that these opinions might easily be changed as semiautonomous and fully autonomous vehicles become more prevalent. For example,\xa0Alphabet\'s\xa0(NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Waymo is conducting extensive driverless-vehicle tests with\xa0members of the public\xa0in Arizona that help the company not only to improve its driverless-car tech, but also to get people to trust it.Earning public trust has been a top priority for\xa0Ford\xa0(NYSE:F) as well. Sherif Marakby, the CEO of Ford Autonomous Vehicles LLC, a subsidiary of Ford, wrote to the U.S. Department of Transportation: ""[D]eveloping self-driving vehicles is not simply about the technology -- it is about earning the trust of our customers and of those cities and businesses that will ultimately use it.""Ford is\xa0developing its own self-driving technology\xa0that it plans to release in 2021 and has been outspoken about taking a slow and steady approach to this tech to make it safe for consumers.There are major privacy concernsDriverless cars will need to constantly know where they are and what their surroundings are. To do this, they\'ll have to connect to cloud-based servers for mapping and decision-making processes, so they\'ll generate and collect data on a much grander scale than vehicles do now. The market for vehicle data monetization hit just $2 billion in 2017, but it\'s expected to skyrocket to $33 billion in 2025.Vehicle data collection is already raising concerns among privacy advocates; a recent paper published by Des Butler, a law professor at Queensland University of Technology in Australia, said that this data will be a ""gold mine"" for companies looking to turn drivers and riders into customers. ""These vehicles will know where you like to frequent, which businesses, and may very well build a profile of you,"" Butler\xa0told\xa0The Guardian\xa0recently.Some advertisers have already sought out data that automakers collect from their vehicles. Back in 2015\xa0BMW\xa0(NASDAQOTH:BAMXF) board member Ian Robertson told\xa0The Financial Times: ""There\'s plenty of people out there saying: \'Give us all the data you\'ve got and we can tell you what we can do with it.\'"" Robertson said that BMW\xa0declined those offers at the time. But in the U.S., just as with driverless-car safety regulations, there are no clear laws about personal data protection that are specific to autonomous vehicles.All of this means that in the coming years Americans may inadvertently hand over more information to companies than ever before -- possibly without even realizing they\'re doing it.The vehicles could become targets for hackersOf course, the more automakers integrate self-driving technologies into their vehicles, the more control hackers could have over a vehicle once they gain access to it. A group of researchers proved this a couple of years ago when they wirelessly\xa0hacked into a Jeep Cherokee\xa0and showed they could control the vehicle\'s steering, transmission, and braking.Shortly after the results were published on\xa0Wired\'s website,\xa0Fiat Chrysler\xa0(NYSE:FCAU) released a formal recall and sent owners a USB drive with a software update to protect their vehicles.One of the benefits of driverless-car safety technology will be that vehicles will be able to communicate with each other and even with the infrastructure around them (like traffic lights and buildings). But some safety experts are concerned that adding so many points of connectivity will make driverless cars extremely vulnerable to hacking and software glitches.""All these connections increase the risk of hacking, just because there are many more entry points for hackers to exploit. It will also increase the risk that a coding bug could cause widespread damage, because an issue in one car could involve accidents with other cars that are communicating with that vehicle,"" Phil Yannella, a partner in Ballard Spahr\'s Privacy and Data Security Group, recently told Reuters in a podcast.While some tech companies like Alphabet have had to deal with hacking issues for years, automakers may not be as adept in fending off attacks. It\'s still too early to tell just how vulnerable autonomous vehicles might be, but based on the Jeep example and the increasing connectivity in self-driving cars, this problem will need to be solved before these vehicles become widely used.Don\'t worry about dystopian driverless cars just yetWhile it\'s beneficial to understand some of the potential problems facing driverless cars, it\'s still not worth worrying about all of these issues just yet. We\'re still a decade or two away from autonomous vehicles being all around us, which means there\'s time to find solutions to all of the problems listed above.But keep in mind that companies betting on driverless-vehicle technologies and services are likely to run into at least a few of these problems. None of them will prevent driverless cars from becoming a major part of transportation services in the coming years, but they could certainly slow down their progress.That\'s why it\'s good for investors to consider driverless-car companies that are playing the long game in this industry. Alphabet\'s Waymo not only has\xa0more autonomous-vehicle experience\xa0than other automakers and tech companies, it\'s also wisely working with the public sector, introducing its technology to the public, and conducting extensive tests with its vehicles to ensure that they\'re safe. All of that doesn\'t mean Alphabet is immune to these problems, but if there\'s a company likely to overcome these hurdles, Alphabet is it.Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool’s board of directors.\xa0Chris Neiger\xa0has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

(TSLA ). Bob Lutz, who held high-level positions at Ford, Chrysler, BMW and General Motors, told  CNBC’s “Closing Bell” program that Tesla may not ever achieve profitability.After months of controversy surrounding the electric car manufacturer, for reasons that both did and did not involve the manufacturing of electric cars, Tesla has drawn different forms of criticism which has caused its\xa0price of shares to\xa0fluctuate. Lutz questioned the company’s ability to produce its flagship Model 3 car at a high enough rate.“[Tesla CEO Elon Musk]\'s got 9,000 people in that assembly plant producing less than 150,000 cars a year. The whole thing just doesn\'t compute,” Lutz told CNBC. ""It\'s an automobile company that is headed for the graveyard.""Production woes have dogged the Model 3 for some time. Tesla had to construct what is essentially  a large tent outside its Fremont, California, plant to house an assembly line so the company could meet its goals. The company has shown increased confidence in its production process in recent months, opening up Model 3 deliveries to the general public and even offering  expedited delivery for some customers.The company is also facing a  federal investigation\xa0stemming from Musk’s infamous take-private tweets, as well as a new line of competition. More established automakers like  Audi and  Mercedes have recently announced fully electric vehicles that could tap into Tesla’s corner of the market.Lutz noted that those other manufacturers have solid enough footing in the traditional car market to handle whatever losses come with electric cars, an advantage over Tesla. He went as far as to say Tesla had “no advantages” whatsoever over those other companies.Tesla did not immediately respond to an International Business Times inquiry into Lutz’s remarks, or the other recent controversies surrounding the company.Shares of Tesla on Tuesday had dropped by as much as 7.7 percent.

(TSLA) for fraud or market manipulation, the Department of Justice on Tuesday has stepped in. The DOJ is investigating the electric car manufacturer for possible fraud in the aftermath of CEO Elon Musk’s failed take-private bid, according to Bloomberg sources.The investigation reportedly centers on Musk’s now-infamous Aug. 7 tweet, in which he declared he had “funding secured” to\xa0make Tesla a private company. Shares of Tesla\xa0surged\xa0after the tweet and ended the trading day with an 11 percent gain.

It was later learned that Musk was referring to discussions with the Saudi Arabian government’s public fund, though no actual deal was in place. Tesla  later announced it had abandoned plans to go private.Declaring that Tesla had secured funding for privatization when that was not actually the case may have constituted fraud. For Tesla’s part, the company said in a statement that the DOJ’s request for documents was voluntary, and the company had fully cooperated with the government agency.""Last month, following Elon\'s announcement that he was considering taking the company private, Tesla received a voluntary request for documents from the DOJ and has been cooperative in responding to it. We have not received a subpoena, a request for testimony, or any other formal process.

(TSLA) has dealt with its share of scandals and controversies, some of which involved the company’s electric vehicles and many of which did not. The latest problem came to light Monday, when a group of researchers from Belgium’s KU Leuven University reported that they had found a way to easily hack the Tesla Model S’s keyless ignition,  Wired reported.Like many modern vehicles, the Model S is unlocked and started by a key fob that sends an encrypted signal to the car to start it, rather than by inserting and turning a key. KU Leuven’s team of hackers spent several months trying to crack the system, and they were successful. After reverse-engineering the keyless entry system, they were able to clone the key fob signal in less than two seconds using around $600 worth of gear, per Wired.They also released a short video demonstration of the hypothetical car theft process. Perhaps the most dangerous aspect of KU Leuven’s findings is that the cloned key fob can be used more than once, allowing the hacker to continue driving the Model S.The good news for Model S owners is that Tesla was alerted to the security crack more than a year ago. A recent update added the ability to lock the Model S behind a four-digit PIN code, similar to unlocking a smartphone, as an added measure of authentication. Aside from that, any Model S made after June 2018 should be immune to the attack.Model S owners who got their cars before June may want to turn on the PIN code function to avoid potential car thefts. The key fob tech was designed by a firm called Pektron, who made similar tech for auto manufacturers like McLaren.Keyless ignition has become more standard in cars in recent years, but it does not come without flaws. Aside from hacking concerns like what KU Leuven found, some car owners have  actually died because they forgot to turn their cars off. The engine kept running in enclosed spaces, like garages, which led to carbon monoxide poisoning.The security flaw in the Model S was caught and remedied before it became a widespread issue, but it could be seen as another hurdle on Tesla’s path to profitability. In recent months, the electric car manufacturer has dealt with everything from  PR scandals involving CEO Elon Musk to the  departures of multiple high-level executives.Shares of Tesla dropped by more than 2.7 percent on Tuesday afternoon.']"

Accounting chief Dave Morton and human resources head Gabrielle Toledano both left Tesla on Friday morning, sending Tesla shares on a downward spiral to end the week.Bloomberg confirmed Morton’s and Toledano’s departures on Friday morning. Morton had only been on the job for less than a month before calling it quits, citing the abnormally high level of public scrutiny the electric car manufacturer faces for seemingly everything other than making cars.“I want to be clear that I believe strongly in Tesla, its mission, and its future prospects, and I have no disagreements with Tesla’s leadership or its financial reporting,” Morton said in his announcement, per Bloomberg.Toledano told Bloomberg she was exiting the company after an extended leave of absence. She had been at Tesla since July 2017.

https://www.ibtimes.com/self-driving-cars-understanding-6-autonomous-levels-2714703,Self-Driving Cars: Understanding The 6 Autonomous Levels,John Rosevear,09/07/18,1:53 AM,"['What does it mean when someone refers to ""Level 4"" or ""Level 5"" self-driving? What are the levels, and who decides which systems qualify?The ""levels"" are taken from a framework established by SAE International, the professional association of automotive engineers, as a shorthand to describe how far a particular system goes in automating the task of driving a vehicle. The SAE\'s framework has been widely adopted by regulators, engineers, and automakers -- and by investors, too.This article originally appeared in the Motley Fool.The SAE\'s framework describes six levels of vehicle automation, ranging from no automation at all -- an old-school car -- to fully automated, meaning a system that can drive at least as well as a skilled human in any situation.It\'s very important for investors looking at companies in the self-driving space to understand what is meant by the various levels, who decides what level to assign to a given system, and the differences between the levels -- particularly as they get more advanced. (I\'ll tell you a secret up front: Sometimes, systems described as ""self-driving"" really aren\'t.)It hasn\'t always been easy to make sense of this framework. As you\'d expect from a society of automotive engineers, the SAE\'s own descriptions of the levels are jargony and a little hard for nonexperts to parse. But for the most part, they make sense when explained in plain English -- and that\'s what you\'ll find below.What is autonomous driving?First and foremost, an ""autonomous driving"" system is one that allows a vehicle to drive safely on public roads without human involvement. Terms like ""automated driving,"" ""driverless vehicle,"" and ""self-driving car"" are all describing the same technology: A computer ""brain"" and sensors that can drive a vehicle in place of a human, at least under some circumstances.Here are a few key things to keep in mind as we dig into the world of automated driving systems:Advanced driver-assist and driverless systems rely on several types of sensors, including cameras, radar, and\xa0lidar\xa0(a\xa0sensor that uses invisible laser beams to precisely measure distances)\xa0to help the vehicle\'s computer ""brain"" understand where the vehicle is relative to its surroundings.The number of sensors used, the amount of computing power required for the ""brain,"" and the overall cost of the system all typically increase as the level of automation increases.Self-driving systems are a form of\xa0artificial intelligence. They generally incorporate\xa0machine learning, meaning algorithms that can adjust themselves and improve their effectiveness as more data is acquired.Fully driverless systems acquire vast amounts of data as they travel from place to place and encounter new traffic situations. The individual vehicles\' systems typically share that data with a remote data center, which updates all of the vehicles using the system with lessons learned. This process is called\xa0fleet learning.There\'s one more thing to know, and it\'s very important to keep in mind as you assess claims about particular systems:The level assigned to any given system is assigned\xa0by its manufacturer. As of right now, there is\xa0no\xa0independent or government agency certifying a given system as Level 3 or Level 4 or whatever. Until that changes, the levels are best thought of as a manufacturer\'s claim: They might be a bit optimistic, so drive carefully.If you\'d like to dig deeper, you\'ll find a comprehensive overview of driverless-vehicle systems\xa0here, with links to even more in-depth information. But those five points are enough for us to get started.    Data source: SAE International. Photo: The Motley Fool  Level 0: No automationThe SAE\'s framework begins with Level 0: No automation. The human driver is responsible for 100% of what the SAE refers to as ""the dynamic driving task,"" meaning the work of actually driving the vehicle on an ongoing basis. (Keep that word ""ongoing"" in your mind as you read on -- it\'s a key part of how the SAE defines automation.)Level 0 isn\'t that hard to understand, but even here there are some nuances. Probably the most important point is this: There are plenty of modern cars with driver-assistance features that still qualify as Level 0.For instance, antilock brakes don\'t count as automation because the human still has to step on the brake pedal. Even systems that automate a momentary task -- like the automatic emergency braking systems found on some new cars -- don\'t count as automation for our purposes, because they don\'t automate the ""dynamic driving task"" on -- you guessed it -- an\xa0ongoing\xa0basis.The takeaway: While your grandfather\'s old Buick is certainly a Level 0 vehicle, so are many modern cars that are equipped with what we think of as ""driver-assist"" features.Level 1: Some assistance for the human driverThe SAE defines a Level 1 system as one that provides\xa0either\xa0steering control or acceleration-and-braking control on an\xa0ongoing\xa0basis -- but only under limited, specific circumstances.What does that mean? Here\'s an example using technology that\'s probably familiar to you.Aside from very basic entry-level models, most cars made in recent years have a cruise-control system. You\'ve almost certainly used one, but if you haven\'t, the principle is simple: Accelerate to a desired speed, activate the cruise control, and the system will hold the vehicle at that speed, even up and down hills, after you take your foot off of the accelerator pedal.That doesn\'t count as ""automation"" in the SAE\'s framework, because the\xa0dynamic\xa0part of the driving task isn\'t automated: The human still has to be ready to hit the brakes (and deactivate the system) if there\'s slower traffic ahead.In recent years, automakers have begun offering more advanced cruise-control systems, so-called adaptive cruise control. Adaptive cruise control systems are smarter: They use radar to keep your car at a safe distance behind the vehicle ahead. If the car ahead slows, the system automatically slows your car as well in an effort to maintain a safe distance.With adaptive cruise control, one part of the dynamic driving task -- controlling acceleration and brakes --\xa0is\xa0automated. Of course, it\'s only automated under specific circumstances, namely when you turn the system on while driving on the highway. But that\'s sufficient to lift an adaptive cruise-control system into Level 1.Level 2: Limited help with steering and brakingLevel 2 is ""partial automation."" It\'s for driver-assistance systems that provide\xa0both\xa0steering and acceleration-and-braking control, but again, only under limited circumstances. If the human driver has to intervene regularly -- for instance, when the car is exiting a highway -- then it\'s probably a Level 2 system. Importantly, it\'s\xa0not\xa0""self-driving,"" even if it kinda-sorta seems like the vehicle is driving itself.That can make understanding Level 2 a little tricky. Let\'s take a closer look.Level 2 can sometimes seem like self-driving, but it isn\'tTesla\'s\xa0(NASDAQ:TSLA)\xa0Autopilot and\xa0General Motors\'\xa0(NYSE:GM)\xa0Super Cruise, both of which can accelerate, brake, and steer under many (but\xa0not\xa0all) circumstances, can certainly deliver an experience that\xa0seems\xa0like ""self-driving."" But there\'s a reason that GM and (usually) Tesla are very careful not to describe them as full self-driving systems in their current forms: With both, the human driver needs to be alert and ready to take over the driving task on very short notice -- more or less instantly.That\'s a critical distinction. If a human driver is needed on short notice, then a system shouldn\'t be described as ""self-driving."" Instead, it\'s properly referred to as an advanced driver-assist system (ADAS).That may sound like splitting hairs, but it\'s a big deal because the expectations around a given system can affect how safe it is in practice.\xa0A Tesla Model S equipped with an early version of Autopilot was involved in a\xa0fatal accident in May 2016\xa0when the car\'s system failed to recognize a tractor-trailer crossing the road -- and the human driver apparently didn\'t intervene to hit the brakes.That was the first known fatal accident involving anything close to a self-driving system, and it emphasized that these systems needed to do a better job of ensuring that human drivers were alert and ready to take control on short notice.That in turn led to considerable discussion within the industry: How could a system ensure that a human driver was alert without excessively annoying the human?The challenge: How to keep the driver alert, but not annoyed?Annoyance may seem like a trivial consideration when we\'re talking about avoiding fatal accidents. But consider this: If the system is too annoying to use, it won\'t get used.The current version of Tesla\'s Autopilot warns drivers not to take their hands off of the steering wheel while the system is in use. To enforce that, the system has sensors that\xa0aim to detect whether the driver\'s hands are on the wheel.If the driver\'s hands aren\'t on the wheel, the system gives a visual reminder after 30 seconds, followed by an audible warning after 45 seconds. After a minute with no intervention by the driver, the Autopilot system shuts off and can\'t be turned back on until the car is restarted.It\'s not a bad system, but reviews have suggested that it\'s easy to fool -- drivers can just nudge the wheel when the lights come on to reset the warning cycle, while otherwise driving hands-free.GM\'s Super Cruise incorporates an elegant solutionGM\'s solution allows for hands-free driving. Instead of detecting steering-wheel motions, it uses a camera to track the driver\'s head position. If the system detects that the driver\'s eyes aren\'t on the road, it begins a series of prompts to try to get the driver\'s attention back on the road.Similar to Tesla\'s alerts, Super Cruise\'s prompts progress from a flashing light in the steering wheel\'s rim, to a beeping sound and seat vibrations, to a voice command -- at which point the Super Cruise system disengages. But GM goes further than Tesla: If the driver still doesn\'t take control at that point, the system will gradually bring the vehicle to a complete stop, activate the hazard warning flashers, and call for help (using GM\'s OnStar system.)GM also built a slew of additional safeguards into Super Cruise to try to ensure that it\'s only used in circumstances it can safely handle. For starters, if the vehicle isn\'t on a highway, the road\'s lane markings aren\'t clearly visible, or the system thinks that the driver isn\'t fully attentive -- it won\'t even switch on. That may sound like a recipe for constant annoyance, but it\'s all elegantly implemented. Most reviewers have agreed that Super Cruise is a pleasure to use.The thing to remember: ""Hands-free"" isn\'t necessarily self-drivingTo sum up, a Level 2 system is an advanced driver-assist system that\xa0can\xa0allow for hands-free driving under limited circumstances. But the human driver has to remain alert and ready to take over the ""dynamic driving task"" on short notice, and the leading systems attempt to ensure that the driver remains alert while the systems are in use.Level 3: A little closer to self-drivingThe SAE defines Level 3 as ""conditional automation."" The difference between Level 2 and Level 3 is a matter of degree. In practice, it depends on the answer to this question: How alert does the human in the vehicle\'s driver\'s seat have to be?With a Level 2 system, the driver needs to be very alert, ready to take over the driving task right away right away if the system encounters something it can\'t handle. With Level 3, the expectation is that the system can handle the driving as long as it\'s within its ""operational design domain,"" meaning that the human\'s role is to be a ""fallback.""Here\'s how the SAE puts it:The sustained and [operational design domain]-specific performance by an [automated driving system] of the entire [dynamic driving task] with the expectation that the [dynamic driving task] fallback-ready user is receptive to [automated driving system]-issued requests to intervene, as well as to [dynamic driving task] performance-relevant system failures in other vehicle systems, and will respond appropriately.Got that? If you\'re thinking that it\'s only a vague difference from Level 2, you\'re not alone.Why many automakers are steering clear of Level 3The difficulty in defining (and explaining) a difference between Level 2 and Level 3 is the problem with Level 3 in practice. It\'s easy for us to understand that a Level 2 system isn\'t true self-driving, while (as we\'ll see below) Level 4\xa0is\xa0self-driving, and it\'s fairly easy to explain that difference to users. But Level 3 seems to exist in between. It\'s self-driving, except when it isn\'t.That presents a challenge for engineers charged with developing a system. In a presentation in 2016,\xa0Ford Motor Company\'s\xa0(NYSE:F)\xa0former global product chief, Raj Nair, explained why Ford\'s road map for self-driving technology\xa0skips Level 3 entirely:We found we couldn\'t safely get through scenarios that really concerned us without adding technology like LiDAR and like high-definition 3D maps. Once you go to that point, you\'re really at the solution for Level 4. So we changed our direction from walking up driver assist technologies, the camera-based and radar-based technologies increasing at percentage, et cetera, to all the way leapfrogging into what does it take to get to Level 4, what does it take to get rid of the driver, what does it take to get rid of the steering wheel, the pedals, and then working on that technology problem.Put simply: Once Ford engineers had added all of the technology needed to make their prototype Level 3 system meet their safety standards, they were essentially at Level 4. Given that, they reasoned, why plan to offer Level 3 at all?But a few Level 3 systems are headed to marketA lot of other automakers have reached the same conclusion about Level 3, but not all. There\'s another point of view, namely that Level 3 could be interpreted as a nicer implementation of the concepts behind Level 2 systems like Super Cruise.That\'s\xa0Audi\'s view. Audi will launch a Level 3 system it calls ""Traffic Jam Pilot"" on its 2019 A8 sedan. Audi\'s pitch for the system effectively captures what it sees as the distinction between Level 2 and Level 3:With Traffic Jam Pilot engaged, drivers no longer need to continuously monitor the vehicle and the road. They must merely stay alert and capable of taking over the task of driving when the system prompts them to do so.But note: While Audi will offer this system in Germany, which recently passed laws making this type of system explicitly legal, Audi won\'t bring it to the United States -- at least, not yet -- because of concerns about liability and regulatory exposure.It\'s not hard to see why. Even in Audi\'s own words, the distinction is still vague. The idea seems to be that Audi\'s system will give the human a bit more time to take over than a Level 2 system would. But still: Does the human in the driver\'s seat need to be paying attention, or not?Fortunately, the next level doesn\'t require such hair-splitting to understand.Level 4: True self-driving, but with limitsThe SAE says that Level 4 is ""high driving automation"": The system doesn\'t need a human backup at all, as long as it\'s operating within its ""operational design domain."" Put another way, a Level 4 system still has limits, but as long as it\'s within those limits, no human intervention will be needed -- it\'s real self-driving.Here\'s what that means in practiceMost of the ""self-driving"" systems under development today depend on highly detailed 3-D maps to help the vehicle\'s ""brain"" know\xa0exactly\xa0where it\'s located, down to a few centimeters (or less). These systems generally use several lidar units\xa0to ""map"" the vehicle\'s surroundings from moment to moment. The lidar images are then compared to a stored 3D map.Some of the systems under development use the lidar-and-maps method as a primary method of locating the vehicle, while others use it as a backup. (One of the principles of full self-driving systems, like autopilot systems in aviation, is that all critical subsystems should have backups in case something fails.)A Level 4 system is true self-driving as long as the system is operating within its limits. It doesn\'t matter whether the human sitting in the driver\'s seat is distracted, asleep, or not even present -- a Level 4 system will get the vehicle safely to its destination, as long as it\'s operating within its intended limits.True Level 4 vehicles are beginning to arriveLevel 4 vehicles are coming soon -- in fact, they\'re already here. Waymo, the\xa0Alphabet\xa0(NASDAQ:GOOGL)\xa0(NASDAQ:GOOG)\xa0subsidiary formerly known as the Google Self-Driving Car Project, began\xa0deploying Level 4 vehicles\xa0in a pilot ride-hailing service in Chandler, Arizona, earlier this year.\xa0General Motors\xa0(NYSE:GM)\xa0has said that its own self-driving subsidiary, GM Cruise, expects to deploy a fleet of ""thousands"" of Level 4 taxis in dense urban environments in the U.S.\xa0starting in 2019. Others will follow over the next few years.But note that Waymo and GM aren\'t choosing locations at random. Waymo spent months ""training"" its prototype vehicles on the roads and traffic conditions in and around the Chandler area; GM Cruise has been doing the same with its Chevrolet Bolt-based vehicles in San Francisco. For now, those vehicles are limited to the areas with which their systems are most familiar, all of which have been very carefully mapped.Those limits are what make the systems Level 4. For instance, no matter how the maps are used, if the vehicle is dependent on a map, that means it\'s limited, because it can\'t go anywhere that isn\'t yet mapped. Of course, a Level 4 system could have other limits; it may not switch on if it detects heavy snow, for instance.Long story short: If a system offers full automated driving within limits, the limits are what makes it Level 4.Level 5: Full unconditional automated drivingLevel 5 is the dream:\xa0Unconditional\xa0(that is, no-limits) automated driving, with no expectation that a human driver will ever have to intervene.Put another way, a Level 5 system should be able to go anywhere a skilled human driver could go, under any conditions a skilled human driver could handle, entirely on its own.Needless to say, there aren\'t any Level 5 systems available now. A few automakers, including Tesla and BMW, have claimed that they will have Level 5 systems within a few years -- but many experts believe that true Level 5 autonomy will take years to develop, if it ever happens at all.It\'s possible that Level 5 systems will be the eventual result after lots of connected Level 4 vehicles are deployed and learning. Remember what I said about machine learning and fleet learning above? Systems that are deployed in thousands of vehicles operating every day will amass huge amounts of data and encounter lots of new situations -- both of which mean they\'ll advance quickly on their own. Between this ongoing fleet learning and the expansion of well-mapped areas, the most widely deployed systems will effectively become Level 5 -- eventually.Maybe.It\'s also possible that a true Level 5 system -- a single system that can safely drive in a Montana snowstorm, a Shanghai traffic jam, and anywhere else a skilled human driver might be able to go -- won\'t come into being for many, many years (notwithstanding the bold promises made by certain CEOs).Why full self-driving might still be years awayFull self-driving is an\xa0incredibly\xa0difficult problem to solve. Consider that even Waymo -- which began way back in 2009 as the Google Self-Driving Car Project and has some of the best and most experienced engineers in the field -- is still having trouble getting its vehicles to safely navigate some routine traffic situations in suburban Chandler, where the situations are all known and the area is carefully mapped. How do you think they\'d fare in a completely unfamiliar environment -- downtown Mumbai, for instance?A capable human driver from suburban Arizona would probably be able to navigate Mumbai pretty well with a smartphone and a bit of familiarization. But at least right now in 2018, it looks like it could be many years before a self-driving system will be able to do the same -- and that means that true ""full self-driving"" won\'t arrive anytime soon.Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool\'s board of directors.\xa0John Rosevear\xa0owns shares of Ford and General Motors.

https://www.ibtimes.com/audi-just-started-mass-producing-new-tesla-fighter-2714294,Audi Just Started Mass-Producing A New Tesla Fighter,John Rosevear,09/06/18,12:31 AM,"['It\'s not ""vaporware"" after all:\xa0Audi AG\xa0(NASDAQOTH:AUDVF)\xa0said that mass production of its first all-electric SUV, the e-tron, began on Monday at a freshly retooled factory in Brussels, Belgium.This article originally appeared in the Motley Fool.The e-tron is an upscale battery-electric SUV aimed squarely at\xa0Tesla\xa0(NASDAQ:TSLA)\xa0and its Model X. It\'s the production version of a much-talked-about concept vehicle, the\xa0Audi e-tron quattro, that the company first showed in 2015. It\'s also the first of a\xa0wave of serious new battery-electric vehicles\xa0expected from brands within the\xa0Volkswagen Group\xa0(NASDAQOTH:VWAGY)\xa0over the next four years.It\'s also the first of several Tesla challengers coming from the German luxury brands between now and the end of next year. Here\'s what we know -- and what it means for investors looking to profit as the world\'s transition to electric vehicles gets underway.What it is: A no-excuses premium electric SUVWe don\'t have all of the final, official specifications for the e-tron yet -- we\'ll get those at Audi\'s official reveal event, scheduled to take place on Sept. 17 in San Francisco. But Audi has been testing lightly disguised e-tron prototypes on public roads for months, and it has shared quite a bit of information along the way.The e-tron is a dual-motor, all-wheel-drive SUV that Audi said will get over 400 kilometers (248.5 miles) of range on Europe\'s new, tougher Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicle Test Procedure (WLTP) cycle. (The WLTP test is more conservative than the old European Union electric-vehicle test standards. Its results have so far tended to be very close to test results using the U.S. standards.)Audi said in July that its close-to-final prototypes have two electric motors that together have 265 kilowatts (kW) of output and develop 413.8 foot-pounds of torque. The e-tron\'s system will allow that maximum output to be delivered for up to 60 seconds, allowing the vehicle to accelerate from 0 to its electronically limited maximum speed of 124 miles per hour (mph) several times consecutively.It\'s nothing like Tesla\'s ""Ludicrous Mode,"" but the e-tron prototype also had a ""boost mode"" available, in which the motors can provide 300 kW of output and 489.7 foot-pounds of torque for 8 seconds. In boost mode, the e-tron prototype could go from 0 to 100 kilometers per hour (62 mph) in ""less than 6 seconds."" (Don\'t get too giddy, Tesla fans: Remember that these figures are for a prototype of the base-spec e-tron. There will surely be faster versions offered later on.)Inside, it\'s an Audi, meaning that the interior is impeccably trimmed and loaded with high-tech features. Among those features is an energy-recovery system that improves both braking and range. Audi claims it\'s the most efficient yet offered by any automaker.How the Audi e-tron will stack up against Tesla\'s Model XAudi hasn\'t yet published dimensions for the e-tron, but it looks like Tesla\'s Model X might be a bit bigger.\xa0\xa0While Audi describes the e-tron as a ""full size"" SUV, it appears to be a two-row vehicle, with seating for five. The Tesla can be ordered with a third row.In Europe, at least, the Audi will be a bit cheaper. Audi has said that the e-tron will start at 80,000 euros (about $92,400) in Europe. In Europe at least, that\'s cheaper than the base 75 kilowatt-hour (kWh) version of the Model X, which starts at 95,830 euros (including taxes) in Germany.The two appear to be closely matched on performance and range. Tesla claims a 0-100 kph time of 5.2 seconds for the Model X 75D, with a top speed of 210 kph (about 130 mph). It hasn\'t yet posted WLTP results for the Model X 75D, but it\'s rated at 237 miles of range in the U.S., so its WLTP range should be similar.Here in the U.S., the Model X 75D is a bit cheaper: It starts at $83,000 before incentives. We don\'t yet know what Audi will charge for the e-tron when it arrives here, likely early in 2019, but there\'s a good chance that the Audi will be more expensive than the Tesla in the U.S.Of course, we don\'t yet know how the Audi e-tron will stack up against the Tesla in an on-the-road comparison test. That will tell us a lot about its sales prospects.The upshot: Audi appears to have a contenderIt looks like the e-tron will join the\xa0Jaguar I-Pace\xa0as the first serious head-to-head competitors to the Tesla Model X. The I-Pace is a size smaller than the X, but -- like the e-tron -- it otherwise compares well on paper, and road tests of the electric Jaguar have been very positive.I expect that the battery-powered Audi will fare similarly. It should compare well with the Tesla, though it\'s unlikely to represent a significant step forward. That\'s probably enough: For buyers who have been intrigued by the idea of an electric vehicle, but hesitant to buy a Tesla, the Audi might be the vehicle they\'ve been waiting for.John Rosevear\xa0has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

Musk said, in no uncertain terms, that he still believes cave rescuer Vernon Unsworth to be a “child rapist” in a series of emails sent to  Buzzfeed News at the end of August.The profanity-laced emails were intended by Musk to be off-the-record responses to Buzzfeed after the publication asked Musk about  possible legal action by Unsworth, though Buzzfeed did not agree to the conditions. The English caver was widely credited by others involved in the rescue operation as a vital part of the mission. He reportedly provided knowledge of the cave system in which  12 youth soccer players and their coach were trapped.“I suggest that you call people you know in Thailand, find out what’s actually going on and stop defending child rapists,” Musk told Buzzfeed. The Tesla CEO then went on to encourage Unsworth to sue him, claiming the caver moved to Thailand for a 12-year-old “child bride.”    Elon Musk called a Thai cave rescuer a 'child rapist.'

Seventeen days after tweeting that\xa0he had ""funding secured""\xa0for a transaction to take\xa0 Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) private at $420 a share, CEO Elon Musk called the whole thing off late on Friday night.This article originally appeared in The Motely Fool.\xa0\xa0In a\xa0post\xa0on Tesla\'s blog, Musk said given the feedback he has received since his initial tweet, ""It\'s apparent that most of Tesla\'s existing shareholders believe we are better off as a public company."" \xa0Of course, with Tesla, the real story is often found between the lines of its official statements. What did Musk say, why did he really call off the buyout attempt, and where does Tesla go from here?What Musk said about his decision to call it offMusk said that after talking to several investment banks and spending ""considerable time"" listening to shareholders, several things are now clear to him:To sum up: At least as of right now, Tesla\'s official conclusion is that going private would be too much of a hassle for the company, and a burden on its shareholders. \xa0But I\'m not sure that passes the smell test. Let\'s look deeper. \xa0Why did Tesla\xa0really\xa0call it off? \xa0As of early Saturday morning, we don\'t have a lot of information. But given what we know, I can think of two reasons why Musk and/or Tesla\'s board might have decided to end the attempt to take the company private.Reason #1: They didn\'t like the priceMusk made one more point in this blog post:Note that he doesn\'t say\xa0at what price\xa0there was ""more than enough funding to take Tesla private."" \xa0Remember that while Tesla may have one of the\xa0all-time great future-growth stories, some\xa0deep cracks have appeared in that story\xa0over the last year. Tesla today is\xa0loaded with debt,\xa0short of cash, and about to face\xa0serious, direct competition\xa0for the first time. \xa0It didn\'t take long after Musk\'s initial tweet about potentially going private for signs to appear that Tesla was\xa0 struggling to find financing\xa0at his proposed buyout price. It\'s very possible that the banks that Musk hired to advise him on the transaction, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, told him that there weren\'t any (or enough) investors to do the deal at the promised $420 per share.Fox Business News reporter Charlie Gasparino had a source inside the discussions, likely someone affiliated with one of the investment banks. Gasparino reported on Thursday that the deal might be a hard sell at $420:\xa0That said, Musk\'s statement might still be true: There might well have been interest among potential financing sources in doing the deal -- at a substantially lower price per share. \xa0Reason #2: Due diligence became a concernA leveraged buyout requires would-be institutional investors to ask a lot of questions. For instance, does Tesla really have 420,000 preorders for the Model 3? Is there anything -- a regulatory action, a disclosure requirement -- blocking the company from raising cash via a stock issue? Are there questions around the deal to merge with Solar City that the company would rather not answer? When Tesla guided to a Model 3 production rate of 5,000 per week by the end of 2017 in the second quarter of last year, did the company have reason to know that wasn\'t going to happen? \xa0These and other hard questions are being asked by Tesla bears every day. At least some of these questions, and likely others, are also being\xa0 asked by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which is reportedly investigating Tesla. \xa0Consider that any major investor in a going-private transaction would insist on careful due diligence around these and other questions before investing. It\'s possible that Musk (and/or Tesla\'s board) decided that the benefits of going private weren\'t worth what might happen if it had to answer these questions fully.Where does Tesla go from here?In a tweet on Wednesday, Gasparino summed up the situation as it appeared to his source at the time:\xa0What does ""option for recapitalization"" mean? It could mean a substantial injection of cash in return for equity, it could mean converting some or all of Tesla\'s outstanding debt to equity -- or it could mean a major reorganization of the company, possibly including a trip through bankruptcy court if Tesla is somehow blocked from raising additional capital.\xa0 \xa0None of those things are likely to enhance Tesla\'s share price, to say the least. A bankruptcy filing could wipe out current shareholders entirely -- but even the measures that fall well short of that could result in substantial dilution, putting heavy pressure on Tesla\'s still-high-flying stock price. \xa0Of course, we also need to remember that this story has already taken several turns that would have seemed wildly improbable a month ago. It\'s entirely possible that another plot twist is in the works. We\'ll find out, probably soon.John Rosevear\xa0has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.\xa0 The Motley Fool\xa0owns shares of and recommends Tesla.\xa0 The Motley Fool\xa0has a\xa0 disclosure policy.

During the interview, Brownlee asked about the possibility of a lower-cost Tesla eventually coming to market.Musk responded that as Tesla gains scale, it may be able to deliver a high-quality car for just $25,000. He suggested that with a lot of hard work, it might be possible to offer a vehicle at that price point about three years from now.This article originally appeared in The Motley Fool.If Tesla were actually able to profitably build a desirable electric car for as little as $25,000, it would be a game changer for the company (and for the auto industry as a whole). At that price point, electric vehicles could quickly come to dominate the market. However, it could easily take a decade for Tesla to bring costs down enough to make this dream a reality -- and other automakers will likely get there first.The Elusive Affordable CarTesla has already experienced considerable success, but it is still firmly in the luxury car market. The cheapest Tesla that can be purchased today\xa0costs $49,000, and a few modest options push the price well beyond $50,000. That\'s beyond the means of most consumers.A $25,000 Tesla would still cost a good deal more than the average compact car, but it would cost less than the typical U.S. vehicle purchase, even after adding on a reasonable number of options. This would clearly get Tesla a lot closer to fulfilling its mission, which is ""to accelerate the world\'s transition to sustainable energy.""However, the idea that Tesla could profitably build a $25,000 vehicle within as little as three years seems wildly unrealistic. Indeed, investors should consider how long it has taken Tesla to deliver a car that can plausibly be described as ""affordable.""In August 2006, Musk published his infamous ""secret Tesla Motors master plan."" In a blog post, he said that the company\'s strategy was to build its Tesla Roadster sports car, use the profit from that model to build a more affordable car that would cost about half as much as the Roadster\'s $89,000 price tag, and then follow that up with an even more affordable car.Instead, Tesla\'s next two models after the Roadster -- the Model S and Model X -- have had average transaction prices higher than $89,000. Neither one was the ""affordable"" car that Musk had promised. The Model 3 fills that role, but it took more than a decade to arrive.Economies Of Scale Are A Long Way AwayFurthermore, it\'s unclear how Musk expects to achieve the economies of scale needed to build a $25,000 electric car anytime soon. Earlier this month, I estimated that the $35,000 base version of the Model 3 would have a\xa0gross margin of around zero\xa0even at a production rate of 6,000 per month. A recent UBS study was even more pessimistic, estimating that Tesla would lose $5,900 per Model 3 at a $35,000 price point.If Tesla can\'t make money on a $35,000 car yet, it would need far greater economies of scale to build a $25,000 car profitably. However, its current factory in Fremont has a theoretical capacity of 500,000 vehicles per year. Its second vehicle assembly plant (which will be located in Shanghai) is still in the planning stages and is at least four or five years away from reaching its full production capacity of 500,000 vehicles per year.In other words, even with both of these factories fully operational, it\'s doubtful that Tesla would have the economies of scale necessary to sell a $25,000 electric car. But if the company has to open several additional factories to make a $25,000 car possible, then it\'s hard to see this low-cost Tesla arriving before the mid-late 2020s.Others Will Probably Get There FirstMusk\'s recognition of the importance of economies of scale also raises questions about Tesla\'s long-term competitiveness in the ""budget"" electric vehicle market. Even after the opening of the Shanghai factory -- and perhaps a future European factory as well -- Tesla\'s annual output will still be a fraction of what the major global automakers produce.Many of the world\'s top automakers have aggressive plans to bring electric vehicles to market over the next five years. Given that they already have massive economies of scale in virtually every aspect of production except for electric motors and batteries, these rivals should be able to develop attractive electric vehicles at a $25,000 price point long before Tesla.Tesla may remain the most desirable electric car brand. But at lower price points, whichever automaker can deliver a product that checks all the boxes at the lowest cost is likely to win. That\'s not going to be Tesla at any point in the foreseeable future.Adam Levine-Weinberg\xa0has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Tesla.

The electric car manufacturer, headed by highly visible CEO Elon Musk, saw its stock price dip below $300 on Monday morning amid fears that the company has not actually secured funding to go private, as Musk promised earlier this month.Tesla shares dropped\xa0Monday before bouncing back up slightly, taking the firm’s stock price just below $300 per share. Shares fell after J.P. Morgan lowered its Tesla price target for December all the way down to $195, from its older $308 target,  according to CNBC.That change occurred due to decreasing investor confidence after Musk’s abrupt assertion that Tesla would go private at $420 per share. The CEO  tweeted the news, along with a declaration that he had secured the necessary funding, in early August.    Tesla shares dropped below $300.

In order to go private, Tesla would likely need a considerable source of funding, leading investors to wonder where exactly, or even if, Musk had actually secured it. In a blog post,  Musk revealed he had discussed the matter with the Saudi government’s PIF for two years, but no deal has officially gone through.Reuters reported over the weekend that the PIF was in talks to invest in a Tesla rival, reducing investor confidence even further.Additionally, the Securities and Exchange Commission reportedly subpoenaed Tesla over the matter.  Legally speaking, Musk’s announcement could have been considered price manipulation or fraud if it was not accurate.Concerns about Musk’s health were raised after a recent  New York Times interview in which the CEO spoke about how difficult running Tesla has been. According to Musk, he works extremely long hours and often has to take Ambien to get any sleep at night. When\xa0Huffington Post co-founder Arianna Huffington publicly urged him to improve his work-life balance, Musk said that was not an option.Ford &amp; Tesla are the only 2 American car companies to avoid bankruptcy.

They have price targets well below $400 for the stock, with Cowen setting it as low as $200. Among the latter six, Efraim Levy, senior equity analyst at CFRA Research, did not provide a price target but thinks “there is significant risk that the transaction doesn’t happen,” adding the company is extremely highly valued, often too richly.Glenna Anderson,\xa0from BMO Wealth Management,\xa0was not in either of the two groups,\xa0but thought the $420 price looks “aggressive.”Tesla (TSLA) shares closed up 0.26\xa0 percent at $356.41 Monday on Nasdaq, after falling to a low of $349.02 during the day.

Goldman Sachs analysts headed by vice-president David Tamberrino have a price target of $210 on the Tesla stock, as per a research note seen by IBT.Musk, who may face a regulatory\xa0probe for his tweet, said his claim that necessary funding had been secured was based on repeated and ongoing conversations with the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia.Cowen analysts led by managing director\xa0Jeffrey Osborne, who had a target of $200 on the stock, said in a note that they ""do not believe the current fundamentals of Tesla support valuation anywhere close to $420 per share."" The analysts cited ""numerous concerns"" they have on the company’s mid-term to long-term positioning and see the current valuation divorced from the fundamentals.At the other end of the spectrum, Ross Gerber, president and CEO at Gerber Kawasaki Wealth & Investment Management has a target of $571, saying Tesla\'s ""long-term value is probably 10 times what it’s worth today 5-10 years from now.""""No one is planning on selling their Tesla stock at $420.

He also said he had secured funding for the proposal, without providing details.Investors and analysts viewed PIF as a natural financing partner. Beyond amassing a stake of just below 5 percent in Tesla, the sovereign wealth fund has poured tens of billions of dollars into technology investments, including $45 billion in SoftBank Group Corp’s (9984.T) Vision Fund over five years.However, a source who is familiar with PIF’s strategy said it was not currently getting involved in any funding process for Tesla’s take-private deal.A second source close to the situation also said PIF was not taking part in any such plan at this stage. This source said that the Saudi fund would not make an investment of this kind without seeking guidance first from Softbank.Reuters reported on Wednesday that SoftBank was not currently pursuing a deal for Tesla given its investment earlier this year in rival GM Cruise.PIF’s reluctance will add to the pressure on Musk to produce details of his financing plan.Tesla’s board has not received a detailed financing plan from him and is seeking more information, Reuters reported on Thursday. [nL1N1V01Y1]The board will make a decision on whether to hire advisers and launch a formal review of Musk’s take-private proposal in the coming days, based on how much detail on the financing plan it receives from Musk, a third source said.The sources requested anonymity because the deliberations are confidential. A spokesman for PIF was not immediately available for comment. A Tesla spokesman declined to comment on behalf of the company and Musk.The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has contacted Tesla to ask about Musk’s assertion on Twitter that funding for his proposed deal was “secured”, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday.Tesla is facing a make-or-break moment in its eight-year history as a public company, as competition from European automakers is poised to intensify with new electric vehicles from Mercedes, Audi, BMW and other rivals.Taking Tesla private would remove the pressure from Musk coming from hedge funds betting that the company’s stock will drop given its production issues and negative cash flow. It would also remove the company from the glare of Wall Street that comes with reporting quarterly earnings publicly.In a letter to employees on Tuesday, Musk suggested a choice for shareholders of selling their shares for $420 each or remaining investors in a private Tesla.Musk has also said he would be looking to keep his ownership of Tesla at around 20 percent in a buyout deal, and that a special purpose vehicle, like the one that exists at his aerospace company SpaceX, would allow Tesla shareholders to remain invested if they so choose.Investment bankers and analysts have so far reacted with scepticism, telling Reuters it would be hard for Musk, whose net worth is pegged by Forbes at $22 billion, to raise the equity and debt financing needed for the deal given Tesla is not turning a profit.Some analysts have suggested that Musk could convince Tesla’s top shareholders, such as Fidelity Investments and China’s Tencent, to roll their equity stakes into the deal, thereby significantly reducing the amount of money needed to be raised.However, the deal structure would come with big logistical and legal challenges when it comes to buying out smaller shareholders, analysts have said.ReutersAdditional reporting by Ed Taylor in Frankfurt and Carl O'Donnell in New York; Editing by Hugh Lawson""]"

There is still no confirmation aside from what Musk said online that Tesla has actually secured the necessary funding to go private.Analysts and investors would likely be aware of a transaction of that magnitude, but there has been radio silence on that front since Musk’s announcement. Musk bemoaned the stock market’s tendency to short Tesla, as well as the pressure of having to meet quarterly financial expectations, in a  more formal statement he released later on Tuesday. There is some speculation that he may have announced the privatization plans in the way he did in order to artificially drive up Tesla’s share price.

The decision has not been finalized, according to Musk, as it would need to go through a shareholder vote. However, Musk expressed optimism in the process and explained his reasoning for privatizing Tesla.As a privately held company, Tesla would not be subject to the quarterly earnings gauntlet that publicly held companies go through four times per fiscal year. In his letter, Musk pointed out that ""as the most shorted stock in the history of the stock market, being public means that there are large numbers of people who have the incentive to attack the company.""Tesla went public in June 2010.

He said existing shareholders would be encouraged to stay, but could be bought out at $420 per share.

Tesla predicted that production of its Model 3 sedan will continue to rise steadily in the coming quarters, while earnings and cash flow will turn positive. It didn\'t hurt that CEO Elon Musk seemed even-keeled during Tesla\'s earnings call — and even apologized for\xa0shutting down analysts\' questions\xa0on the first-quarter call.This article originally appeared in the Motley Fool.\xa0Still, many bears were flummoxed by Tesla stock\'s big jump, given that the company posted a record loss last quarter. However, the massive loss can be explained by launch costs related to ramping up Model 3 production. Investors should be far more concerned about management\'s forecast that Model 3 gross margin will remain below 25\xa0percent through the end of 2018.Tesla lost a lot of money last quarter On Wednesday, Tesla reported a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $718 million for the second quarter of 2018. That was slightly greater than its first-quarter loss and more than double the loss it recorded in the year-earlier period. Results didn\'t look much better on a non-GAAP basis, either, as Tesla\'s loss more than doubled year over year to $520 million, or $3.06 per share.Tesla\'s net loss was somewhat bigger than what most analysts had projected. That said, the company predicted it will turn profitable in the back half of the year, despite an expected headwind from higher Chinese auto tariffs. While that forecast isn\'t new, many investors have been skeptical that it was achievable.However, it makes sense that Tesla would see a sharp improvement in profitability during the second half of 2018. The company expects to nearly double Model 3 production this quarter compared with the second quarter, which will help it cover fixed costs and boost gross margin.Gross margin is finally risingIn the first quarter of 2018, Tesla\'s gross margin for Model 3 production was negative. In other words, Tesla wasn\'t even covering all of its production costs for the Model 3, let alone paying for development costs, selling expenses, or corporate overhead. Last quarter, ""Model 3 gross margin turned slightly positive,"" according to the company.Tesla expects dramatic improvement on this front in the second half of 2018, due to higher production -- it expects to build 50,000 to 55,000 Model 3s this quarter -- and the introduction of the pricier dual-motor and performance variants. Tesla says Model 3 gross margin is likely to reach 15\xa0percent in the third quarter and 20\xa0percent in the fourth quarter.This outlook would appear to put Tesla on track to hit its 25\xa0percent gross margin target sometime in 2019. That\'s just what the company says it expects.This vehicle mix is unsustainableWhile Model 3 gross margin is set to improve dramatically over the next two quarters, it still isn\'t clear that the 25\xa0percent goal is within reach. It\'s important to note that Model 3 gross margin is being boosted by a mix heavily tilted toward the most profitable versions in the second half of 2018. This rich mix is clearly unsustainable.As I have previously noted, the cheapest Model 3 variant currently available costs $49,000,\xa0far more than the base price\xa0of $35,000. With the dual-motor and performance versions having entered production recently, the Model 3 average transaction price could easily be around $60,000 in the second half of 2018.There is clearly a meaningful pool of demand for Model 3s in this price range. Nevertheless, the vast majority of buyers can\'t afford to spend this much -- especially as the U.S. electric-vehicle tax credit phases out for Tesla purchases.Indeed, there are hundreds of thousands of Tesla customers in the U.S. and Canada who have ordered or reserved a Model 3. Customers who want to buy dual-motor or performance variants have had a big incentive to place their orders ASAP, since the tax credit will start to phase out on Jan. 1. Instead, Tesla has opened up ordering to non-reservation holders, with a lead time of just a few months, or roughly one quarter. This move implies that far fewer than 100,000 reservation holders have placed orders. The rest are waiting for cheaper Model 3 versions to become available -- or have decided to cancel their reservations.A downshift in the model mix will hurt profitabilityOptions and upgrade packages typically carry very high margins for automakers. If Tesla expects to earn a $12,000 gross profit on a $60,000 car by the fourth quarter, a 20 percent gross margin, it\'s likely that it would only break even on a $35,000 base model.Tesla will probably be able to squeeze out some additional cost efficiencies in 2019. But given that it already expects to be building 6,000 Model 3s per week by the fourth quarter, there will be limited room for gross margin improvement. To look at it another way, going from producing an average of 4,000 Model 3s per week in the third quarter to 6,000 per week in the fourth quarter is expected to lift gross margin from 15\xa0percent to only 20 percent.Meanwhile, the production mix is likely to shift dramatically toward cheaper models next year. This could more than offset Tesla\'s underlying cost reductions. As a result, Tesla probably won\'t be nearly as profitable as it expects.Adam Levine-Weinberg\xa0has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Tesla.

As\xa0expected, revenue soared and losses continued to mount. Beyond the quarter's financial results, Tesla's second-quarter update provided an important glimpse into other important areas, including Model 3 production, a forecast for cash to increase in the second half of the year, and more.This article originally appeared in the Motley Fool.Here's an overview of the results.    Data source: Tesla's second-quarter shareholder letter.  Photo: Motley Fool  Driven primarily by an 85% year-over-year increase in deliveries, Tesla's revenue increased 43% year over year to a record $4 billion. During the quarter, Tesla delivered 40,768 vehicles. Combined Model S and X deliveries amounted to 22,319 units, and Model 3 deliveries were 18,449.Highlighting how sharp Tesla's ramp-up in Model 3 production and deliveries is, the important vehicle's deliveries increased 125% sequentially.Tesla's non-GAAP loss per share of $3.06 was wider than its loss of $1.33 in the year-ago quarter, but it was narrower than its non-GAAP loss per share of $3.35 in Q1. Tesla's GAAP loss per share widened from a loss of $2.04 in the year-ago quarter to a loss of $4.22 in Q2, but this loss was nearly in line with its $4.19 loss per share in Q1.HighlightsLooking aheadManagement believes the second half of the year will be far better than the first, driven by soaring Model 3 production and profitability.Expecting to achieve a Model 3 production rate of 6,000 units per week by the end of August, management anticipates seeing Model 3 production rise from 28,578 units\xa0in Q2 to 50,000 to 55,000 units in Q3. Model 3 deliveries are expected to be even higher during the period.As Model 3 production and deliveries increase, Tesla expects to achieve improved economies of scale. Management said it expects a Model 3 gross margin of 15% in Q3 and about 20% in Q4. As a result, Tesla\xa0still expects\xa0to achieve GAAP profitability in Q3 and Q4 and believes its $2.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents will increase in both quarters.Longer-term, Tesla says it's aiming to achieve a Model 3 production rate of 10,000 units per week sometime next year.Daniel Sparks\xa0owns shares of Tesla.

https://www.ibtimes.com/auto-suppliers-retool-chase-electric-vehicle-bonanza-2704663,Auto Suppliers Retool To Chase Electric Vehicle Bonanza,Nick Carey,08/01/18,10:24 AM,"['ST. PAUL, Minn. - In what seems to be a magic trick, Dele Fayemi runs a batch of batteries in a beaker of boiling water - a physical impossibility that should cause a short circuit.But instead of a highly-dangerous combination of water and electricity, the 3M Co (MMM.N) engineer is testing the batteries in Novec, a non-flammable, non-conductive liquid the conglomerate has sold to cool supercomputers, and which it now aims to sell to automakers to cool batteries.Maintaining a constant, low temperature helps electric vehicles (EVs) drive longer distances, so keeping batteries cool could help solve a key problem for automakers: a lack of range has been a major obstacle to the mass adoption of electric cars.“As you can see, the temperature remains constant,” at 32 Celsius (90 Fahrenheit), Fayemi said, the boiling point of this particular batch of Novec, which 3M also wants to sell to data centers to keep servers cool.“Automakers are trying to figure out how to get the absolute maximum out of batteries,” said Ray Eby, head of 3M’s automotive electrification program, which was created last year. “That’s right in 3M’s wheelhouse.”Major automakers plan to roll out hundreds of new electric vehicle models over the next several years, fueled by investments that consultancy AlixPartners has estimated at up to $255 billion through 2023.To put that in context, in 2017 all the world’s automakers and suppliers combined invested $115 billion in research and development, and had capital expenditures of $234 billion.Much of that investment will flow to suppliers, but only if they can offer ways to cut electric vehicle manufacturing costs, which are still higher than for internal combustion cars. 3M and other automotive technology companies are looking for ways to adapt to electric vehicles existing products that enjoy economies of scale from other markets.Along with major suppliers like BorgWarner Inc ( BWA.N ) and Aptiv PLC ( APTV.N ), others like aluminum company Norsk Hydro ASA ( NHY.OL ) and synthetic rubber maker Trinseo SA ( TSE.N ) are developing products to extend the driving ranges of electric vehicles, attacking a significant barrier to higher sales.Suppliers hope automakers will adopt their technology early in the development process so they can sell similar products to more than one customer.With no set approach to developing EVs, automakers are pursuing their own paths, giving suppliers a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to influence what parts and even what materials to use.“Eventually we’ll see more standardization in the high-voltage market, but it’s not there yet,” said Alan Amici, vice president of transportation solutions for TE Connectivity Ltd ( TEL.N ).That’s why TE and other suppliers using embedded teams of engineers within the engineering operations of major automaker customers. From inside, suppliers can pitch existing products and materials, or ones they have in development.Their customers are looking for ways to get more driving miles per charge, tackle technical problems such as electromagnetic interference or, most importantly, cut costs on vehicles that are as yet unprofitable.St. Paul-based 3M formed its automotive electrification group as global automakers rolled out ambitious investment plans, the bulk of which are earmarked for China. The Chinese government has enacted escalating electric-vehicle quotas starting in 2019.3M will not disclose its spending on EV technology, but executive chairman Inge Thulin says it is a “big, big investment.”The company has already provided “thermal management” technology for General Motors Co’s ( GM.N ) Bolt EV to extend its range.Taiwanese auto startup Xing Mobility is using Novec to cool the batteries in its high-performance Miss R model, and 3M says other automakers are working to adopt the technology, but declined to disclose names.3M also aims to repurpose filter technology used in cell phones for EVs to make infotainment screens and consoles brighter while at the same time using less energy, helping boost battery range.It also has technology, again from cell phones, to cut electromagnetic interference - that, for instance, enables EVs to drive under power lines without various functions cutting out.Making vehicles lighter extends EV range.Norsk Hydro, which already supplies Tesla Inc ( TSLA.O ), is figuring out how to marry up products from two of its own businesses, extruded body-frame parts and precision tubing, to develop new ways for cooling battery packs, said Mike Tozier, who leads Hydro’s advanced product development in North America.That way, Hydro should be able to provide automakers with more ways to lighten their loads and thus make aluminum a more attractive choice.“Automakers are more comfortable with steel, so you’re automatically fighting an incumbent material there,” Tozier said. “But automakers are looking aggressively at more options because they have to remain cost competitive at high volumes.”The push to find ways to add to EV range extends down to the tires.Trinseo has invested in a plant in Germany that will increase its synthetic rubber production capacity 33 percent to meet anticipated growth in electric vehicle production, and will help the supplier develop more efficient products. Tires made with synthetic rubber can already boost efficiency by 12 percent compared to conventional tires, said Hayati Yarkadas, a senior vice president at the company.“The development cycle requested for EVs is significantly shorter and faster than what we have faced with the traditional automotive industry,” he said.ReutersReporting By Nick Carey.

The electric car manufacturer is apparently testing a new method to bring cars directly to buyers from factories, with outspoken CEO Elon Musk overseeing one delivery personally.Customer Devin Scott tweeted photos of the home delivery on Sunday. Musk retweeted it, explaining that the process used a trailer to get the car to Scott from the plant.We tried out a new delivery system using an enclosed trailer straight from factory to owner’s home, so super convenient &amp; car arrives in pristine condition without wasting plastic wrap https://t.co/exNyhb0zOT&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 30, 2018While that particular delivery could be considered a\xa0promotion for Tesla, there is still some substance to it. Home deliveries are not new, but Tesla has never offered the option straight from the factory before, according to  electric car site Electrek. Usually, Tesla vehicles are taken to delivery hubs near buyers rather than directly to their homes.It has been clear for a while that Tesla needs to streamline the delivery pipeline in any way it can. Earlier this month, the firm  opened up Model 3 orders to the general public. Around the same time, Tesla started testing out a  faster checkout process for new owners who show up to retrieve their Model 3s from delivery centers.    Tesla is testing home deliveries straight from the factory. The Tesla logo is shown on the front of a new Tesla Model S car at a Tesla showroom on November 5, 2013 in Palo Alto, California.

However, it can still take several months for Model 3 owners to actually get their cars. Musk had to  personally dispute an analyst report that customers were canceling orders en masse.As  CNET pointed out, home deliveries straight from the factory might not do much to reduce the strain on deliveries. It might still ultimately be more efficient to stick with the local delivery center model.Regardless of the method, getting more cars to more customers might be the trick to easing investor concerns about Tesla.

The  Wall Street Journal reported Sunday that Elon Musk’s ambitious car company had asked suppliers to refund Tesla payments so the company can become profitable.As a result, Tesla shares are  down\xa0roughly 4 percent at the time of writing.Profitability is one of many concerns investors have about Tesla.  Musk committed to making the company profitable in the third and fourth quarters of this fiscal year back in April. The Palo Alto, California-based company reported a profit in the third quarter of 2016, but ran through $3.4 billion in cash last year,  per CNBC.    Tesla reportedly asked suppliers for refunds.

Photo: Robyn Beck/AFP/Getty Images  The Tesla memo that prompted the Journal report was not clear about which suppliers were asked for retroactive refunds. It did, however, report that all suppliers were contacted about helping the company attain profitability. At least some of those suppliers never got the request, according to the Journal.As he typically does, Musk took to Twitter to respond to the claim. He said only costs from the next quarter and beyond are relevant.Only costs that actually apply to Q3 &amp; beyond will be counted. It would not be correct to apply historical cost savings to current quarter.&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 23, 2018A Tesla spokesperson provided the following statement to International Business Times. Tesla also said a memo was not sent out to all suppliers, contrary to the Wall Street Journal's report.“Negotiation is a standard part of the procurement process, and now that we’re in a stronger position with Model 3 production ramping, it is a good time to improve our competitive advantage in this area. We’re focused on reaching a more sustainable long term cost basis, not just finding one-time reductions for this quarter, and that’s good for Tesla, our shareholders, and our suppliers who will also benefit from our increasing production volume and future growth opportunities. We asked fewer than 10 suppliers for a reduction in total capex project spend for long-term projects that began in 2016 but are still not complete, and any changes with these suppliers would improve our future cash flows, but not impact our ability to achieve profitability in Q3. The remainder of our discussions with suppliers are entirely focused on future parts price and design or process changes that will help us lower fundamental costs rather than prior period adjustments of capex projects. This is the right thing to do.”Tesla has not had an easy time of it in the stock market lately. Shares fell last week after  multiple PR scandals involving Musk. Days later, the billionaire magnate had to shake off  analyst claims that more people were canceling their Model 3 delivery orders than making new ones.Production concerns have dogged Tesla for some time. The company appears more confident in its ability to quickly manufacture vehicles in recent weeks, having  just opened up Model 3 orders to the general public for the first time.There have been reports of  unsafe working conditions at the company’s Fremont, California, plant and  widespread layoffs have reduced investor confidence in the firm.""]"
https://www.ibtimes.com/tesla-expects-enormous-growth-solar-2700994,Tesla Expects 'Enormous' Growth In Solar,Daniel Sparks,07/19/18,4:44 AM,"['Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) has consistently been very optimistic about its energy business. But only one side of its energy business — storage —\xa0has taken off so far. Tesla\'s solar business has essentially been in decline since the company acquired SolarCity in November 2016. In Tesla\'s first quarter of 2018, for instance, deployment of solar-energy generation systems nearly halved, falling from 150 megawatts in the first quarter of 2017 to 76 MW.This article\xa0originally appeared\xa0in the Motley Fool.But despite Tesla\'s anemic solar sales recently, management says its energy business is on track. Indeed, Tesla says it\'s preparing for a surge in sales.What\'s the holdup?Since Tesla recently\xa0lost its spot as the top residential solar installer\xa0in the U.S., a surface-level view of its solar business may lead some investors to conclude the company\'s ambitions for the unit have scaled back. Furthermore, falling sales might suggest that demand for the company\'s solar products is suffering. But neither of these is the case.""No one should see us as stepping back from solar,"" Tesla chief technology officer J.B. Straubel said in an\xa0interview\xa0this week with\xa0USA Today. ""In fact, it\'s the opposite."" The CTO went on to explain that demand is off the charts, and the company is ""aggressively ramping"" its solar production capacity.Tesla asserts that its declining solar sales are a result of both the company\'s efforts to make higher-margin sales that contribute cash flow, and its near-term focus on ramping up Model 3 production.""Rather than prioritizing the growth of MW of solar deployed at any cost, we are selectively deploying projects that have higher margin and generate cash up front,"" Tesla explained in its first-quarter shareholder letter in 2017. ""This will improve the business unit\'s cash generation,"" management noted.Tesla has done exactly this, according to the company\'s first-quarter 2018 shareholder letter earlier this year: ""Cash and loan system sales [as opposed to leases] made up 66% of residential deployments in the quarter, up from 31% in Q1 2017 and 9% in Q1 2016."" As a result, the letter explained, Tesla\'s solar business has successfully become cash flow positive:Due to higher upfront cash sales, lower emphasis on less profitable commercial projects and consolidation of our sales channels, our solar business had slightly positive cash flow throughout 2017. We are expecting cash flow from our solar business to remain at this level in the first half of 2018 and then improve significantly thereafter.It\'s more critical than ever right now for Tesla\'s solar unit to produce cash flow for the company, as Tesla is burning through cash amid its capital-intensive Model 3 production ramp-up. And Tesla is facing\xa0 a self-induced cash crunch\xa0as the company attempts to prove to investors that it can survive the Model 3 ramp-up without raising any fresh capital in 2018.But as Model 3 production stabilizes at a rate above 5,000 units per week, the company expects to become profitable, and subsequently focus more on other areas of its business.Growth is on the horizon With Tesla recently achieving its target Model 3 production rate of 5,000 units per week and now aiming for a rate of 6,000 units per week by the end of August, the company will likely begin to shift more of its resources to ramping up its solar business. Indeed, growth in solar will likely be ""mild"" for the next ""quarter or two before our revised sales strategy starts to show its full impact in final deployments,"" Tesla forecast.In addition, Tesla wants to make sure it delivers when it comes to quality and the customer experience before it ramps up production and deliveries of its solar roof. ""We are working to enhance the product design and manufacturing process [of the solar roof] in order to improve the customer experience while reducing manufacturing cost and achieving high levels of quality,"" Tesla said in the first-quarter update.Tesla may, therefore, be just a few quarters away from a big increase in solar production and sales. Straubel is particularly optimistic. ""We\'re not worried,"" he told\xa0USA Today. ""The growth ahead will be enormous.""Daniel Sparks\xa0owns shares of Tesla.

BAFA said it tried to negotiate the matter with Telsa over the past few months but failed to agree\xa0on\xa0a deal.About 800 Tesla Model S owners who bought their vehicle in March must pay back\xa04,000 euros (about $4,650) of an electric vehicle subsidy, according to Reuters. The Model S lost its subsidy eligibility in November after Germany discovered Tesla was producing cars well above the 60,000 euros price tag.""The subsidy needs to be repaid by 800 people who had received it, and another 250 customers who had been notified they were eligible and who will now not receive it,"" a spokeswoman said on Wednesday, adding that those who bought a Tesla costing less than 60,000 euros can apply for the bonus.Tesla, meanwhile, plans to appeal the decision and said it would pay customers for the bonus until the matter comes to a resolution. The electric car brand added that German Tesla customers have always had the option of purchasing a base version of the Model S, which met the standards for the subsidy.""The arbitrary decision to temporarily remove Tesla from the list of vehicles eligible for the Environmental Bonus (Umweltbonus) was unjustified, contrary to the stated goals of the program, and unfair to our customers,"" a Tesla spokesperson said in an emailed statement.""We are appealing [the German government\'s] decision to take this action against our pre-March 2018 customers.

The electric-car pioneer\xa0produced more than 5,000 Model 3s\xa0in the final week of the second quarter. While Tesla isn\'t yet capable of sustaining that level of output, by the end of the third quarter, it may be able to build as many as 6,000 Model 3s per week.This article originally appeared in the Motley Fool.However, supply constraints should no longer be the No. 1 worry for Tesla investors. A bigger concern is that Tesla could quickly run through much of the demand for its priciest -- and thus most profitable -- Model 3 configurations. That\'s a problem because it isn\'t clear that Tesla can make money building a basic $35,000 Model 3.Tesla opens up Model 3 ordering and adjusts lead timesIn the past week, Tesla investors have gotten two disturbing signals that demand for pricier versions of the Model 3 may not be as strong as many bulls expected.First, Tesla announced a week ago that anyone in the U.S. or Canada can now configure and order a Model 3, as long as they want the long-range battery and premium interior options at a minimum. Previously, Tesla was only taking orders from customers who had put down $1,000 to reserve a spot in line. (Tesla currently says that the standard-battery Model 3 will be available in six to nine months -- that is, early 2019.)Second, just within the past few days, Tesla reduced the estimated lead times for Model 3 orders by one to two months. It projects that dual-motor performance models and rear-wheel-drive models ordered today will be delivered in one to three months, while dual-motor models without the performance upgrade will be delivered in two to four months. (All three of these versions include the long-range battery.)The premium backlog is running lowTogether, these two developments indicate that most Model 3 reservation holders want to pay the bare minimum -- or close to it -- for their cars. As of the end of the first quarter, Tesla reported having more than 450,000 net reservations for the Model 3. Tesla built 28,578 Model 3s last quarter, and assuming that it builds an average 5,000 per week during the third quarter -- which seems like a best-case scenario -- it would churn out another 65,000 during that three-month period.Thus, Tesla is likely to build fewer than 100,000 Model 3s during the second and third quarters combined. Based on the updated lead times for new orders, it appears that the backlog of orders for the premium Model 3 versions that Tesla is currently building will run out around the end of the quarter. By the fourth quarter, Tesla will be building Model 3s primarily (or even exclusively) for customers who weren\'t on the reservation list.In other words, of the greater than 450,000 Model 3 reservations that Tesla had on the books a few months ago, no more than 100,000 have converted to orders. The other 350,000 reservation holders are waiting for cheaper Model 3s to become available -- or have decided to cancel their reservations.Reducing production costs will be key to Tesla\'s futureOver the past year, many Tesla bears have warned that the company will face a huge increase in competition as rival automakers roll out a slew of electric car models. However, while there\'s a grain of truth in this argument, Tesla has legions of fans across the world who see the company as different from other automakers. These fans don\'t want electric cars: They want Teslas.The bad news for Tesla is that most of its fans can\'t afford its products. The Model 3 -- Tesla\'s ""affordable"" car -- currently has a starting price of $49,000 and a top price of $80,000.Even with its plans to exclusively build the most expensive Model 3 variants at a relatively high rate, Tesla expects Model 3 gross margin to reach just\xa020 percent\xa0in the second half of 2018. If Tesla\'s production mix shifts drastically toward cheaper Model 3s in 2019 -- because many customers are already stretching to pay $35,000 to $40,000 for a car -- gross margin could recede again.Tesla needs to reach its 25% gross margin target to support its investments in new models and additional production capacity. As a practical matter, this means that it must radically cut Model 3 production costs over the next few quarters. Unless it can do so, all the demand in the world for $35,000 Model 3s won\'t be enough to snap Tesla stock out of its recent funk.Adam Levine-Weinberg\xa0has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

The fall could be attributed to what was a disastrous public relations weekend for the electric car manufacturer’s outspoken founder.Musk’s most controversial act over the weekend  was to call British caver Vern Unsworth a pedophile. He later deleted the tweet and Musk did not respond to the BBC's request for comment.Unsworth assisted in the rescue of a Thai youth soccer team by providing knowledge of the cave system they were trapped in. He also publicly criticized Musk’s potential involvement in the rescue, saying the experimental submarine Musk wanted to use would not have worked.

We\'ve already seen one, the impressive Jaguar I-Pace crossover.This article\xa0originally appeared\xa0in the Motley Fool.But what are the others? And when will they arrive?Below you\'ll find the roadmap, a handy-dandy guide to when we can expect the long-talked-about Tesla challengers, upscale battery-electric vehicles from established automakers, to actually arrive at dealers.2018: Jaguar and (maybe) an Audi SUVFirst up is the I-Pace, the crossover SUV from\xa0Tata Motors\'\xa0(NYSE:TTM) Jaguar luxury brand. The I-Pace has already begun shipping in Europe, but it won\'t arrive in the United States until the second half of 2018.If you follow electric vehicle news, you probably know\xa0all about the I-Pace. But just in case, here\'s a quick summary: dual motors, all-wheel-drive, a 90 kilowatt-hour (kWh) battery giving 240 miles of range, 0 to 60 miles per hour in 4.5 seconds, starting price of $69,500.Also coming soon, but not quite that soon: An electric SUV from\xa0Audi AG  \xa0based on a concept vehicle that Audi\xa0first showed in 2015. Audi has been referring to it as the ""e-tron quattro,"" though it may get another name before production. Audi promises around 280 miles of range from a 95-kWh battery pack driving a\xa0three-motor system — one motor in front, two in back.Whatever Audi calls its handsome electric SUV, it\'s expected to begin arriving at European dealers at the very end of this year, and at U.S. dealers in the first half of 2019. Audi said its price in Europe will start at 80,000 euros (about $93,000). U.S. pricing isn\'t yet known, but it\'ll be in that ballpark.2019: Mercedes-Benz joins the premium-EV frayDaimler AG\xa0(NASDAQOTH:DDAIF)\xa0has a slew of electric-vehicle initiatives under way, including an all-electric Class 8 (tractor-trailer) truck for its Freightliner brand that will take on Tesla\'s Semi.Naturally, Mercedes-Benz also figures prominently in its plans. Mercedes is expected to launch its first premium long-range electric vehicle, the EQC, in 2019. The EQC is a five-passenger SUV with two motors and a 70 kWh battery pack that is expected to give it around 250 miles of EPA-rated range. Mercedes promises a 0 to 62 miles per hour time of under five seconds, putting it in the same ballpark as the Audi and the Jaguar (and the base versions of Tesla\'s Model X).The introduction of the second premium electric Audi, called (again, for now) the e-tron Sportback, will also happen in 2019. Its specs are similar to those of the e-tron quattro, but the shape is different: It\'s sort of a cross between an SUV and a sleek coupe-like sedan. One can envision it taking sales from Tesla\'s Model S, assuming that the price and performance are competitive.Possibly arriving in 2019: The long-awaited electric Porsche. Known as the Mission E in\xa0concept form, Porsche said earlier this month that its first-ever electric production car will be known as the Taycan (TIE-can).The Taycan will bring a slew of innovations, including an 800-volt drive system that will allow for super-fast recharging (about 15 minutes to an 80% charge). Porsche promises all-wheel drive, a 0 to 62 miles per hour time of ""under 3.5 seconds,"" and a battery system that will allow for repeated full-power acceleration runs, something that the fastest Teslas struggle with.Two things we don\'t yet know for sure: When it will arrive, and what it will cost. I expect Porsche to offer several trim levels, with power and performance rising along with price — likely from around $85,000 to around $150,000. As for when, late 2019 or early 2020 seem to be the best guesses at the moment.Also possibly in 2019: The next electric Jaguar is expected to be an all-new version of the big XJ sedan. Jaguar hasn\'t yet announced it —\xa0that\'s expected by the end of 2018 —\xa0but it\'s believed to be fairly far along in development. Jaguar has already announced a major investment to reconfigure one of its U.K. factories to build electric vehicles, with the work expected to start early in 2019.It\'s not out of the question that the first examples of this new electric Jaguar sedan could ship by the end of next year, but 2020 may be more realistic.2020: BMW jumps in, and the next Tesla arrivesThe picture gets fuzzier in 2020. We know that\xa0BMW AG\xa0(NASDAQOTH:BAMXF) will launch an\xa0electric version\xa0of its huge-selling X3 crossover in 2020, and that Tesla has said its Model Y — a\xa0compact crossover based on the Model 3\xa0— could arrive in that year.Beyond that, we don\'t know yet. Mercedes-Benz is known to be working on at least two more electric vehicles — a small premium car called the EQA, and an electric version of its big (and expensive) S-Class sedan, which might be called the EQS and is expected in 2020.It\'s possible that we\'ll see an electric Cadillac by 2020, too.\xa0General Motors\xa0(NYSE:GM) is planning a\xa0slew of electric vehicles\xa0to be based on an all-new architecture expected in about 2021, but it has also said that there will be two new electric vehicles launched before then. Those two will share the electric-drive system developed for the current Chevrolet Bolt EV. One is expected to be a small Buick crossover, which wouldn\'t quite compete with Tesla — but there have been hints that the other could be a Cadillac, which might.Last but not least, Daimler is reportedly working on a big all-electric luxury sedan, which will probably take the name EQS when it arrives — possibly in 2020.The takeaway: Tesla\'s competition is finally arrivingCan Tesla compete directly with the big global automakers? That\'s the question Tesla skeptics have been asking for years. We\'re finally starting to find out: Early reviews of the I-Pace have been very positive with at least some reviews saying that the Jaguar is a step ahead of Tesla in some important ways.We\'ll soon have several more points of comparison. Will Tesla prevail, or will the Silicon Valley upstart have to up its game? We\'ll know in a year or two.John Rosevear\xa0owns shares of General Motors.

But the electric-car maker\'s attention has mostly centered around its newest vehicle: the Model 3. Meanwhile, the Model S and X have sort of become sort of an afterthought. There\'s good reason, of course, for all of the Model 3\'s attention. As Tesla\'s most affordable vehicle yet, the automaker expects the important car to drive massive growth in the company\'s top line, and even\xa0help it achieve profitability.This article\xa0originally appeared in the Motley Fool.But how are Model S and X deliveries doing? Combined Model S and X deliveries in the first quarter marked a pullback compared to levels seen in recent quarters. Can sales of Tesla\'s flagship vehicles pick back up?Taking a hitDuring its first quarter, Tesla delivered 21,815 Model S and X vehicles combined,\xa0lower than the combined Model S and X deliveries in any of the previous six quarters, and down substantially from the 28,425 Model S and X vehicles Tesla delivered in its fourth quarter of 2017.The meaningful pullback in Model S and X deliveries in Tesla\'s first quarter was due to ""Short-term operational and logistical issues led to an increase in the number of Model S and Model X vehicles in transit to customers at the end of Q1,"" Tesla said in its first-quarter shareholder letter.Making matters worse, these temporary challenges for Model S and X deliveries are expected to persist during the electric-car company\'s second quarter, management explained in its first-quarter shareholder letter: ""We are in the process of changing the quarterly production pattern of Model S and X vehicles for the various worldwide regions to ensure a more linear flow of deliveries through the quarter. We believe this will provide a better customer experience and reduce the stress on our delivery system.""As a result, Tesla expects combined Model S and X deliveries during its second quarter to remain at this lower level.Looking for a reboundBeyond Tesla\'s first quarter, though, there\'s good reason to expect Tesla\'s Model S and X deliveries to rise higher.First and foremost, Tesla has made it very clear that\xa0demand is not the reason\xa0behind its pullback in Model S and X deliveries recently. In fact, demand for the vehicles is ""very strong,"" Tesla said in its first-quarter shareholder letter. ""After all-time record orders in Q3 and Q4 2017, we had our highest ever Q1 for orders,"" Tesla said. In addition, management said demand was exceeding supply at the time of its first-quarter shareholder letter.Given its robust demand for Model S and X, Tesla continues to forecast a total of 100,000 Model S and X deliveries during 2018, despite only delivering 21,815 units in its first quarter and expecting under 42,000 units in the first half of the year. In other words, Tesla expects total Model S and X deliveries in the second half of the year to rise 19% compared to the first half of the year.Of course, there\'s no guarantee Tesla will pull this off -- even if demand for the two vehicles remains strong. The automaker may need to reallocate more resources toward\xa0its aggressive Model 3 production ramp\xa0than expected. Investors, therefore, should look for management to reaffirm its full-year guidance for 100,000 Model S and X deliveries when it shares its quarterly update on first-quarter production and deliveries in a few weeks.Daniel Sparks\xa0owns shares of Tesla.

https://www.ibtimes.com/everything-you-need-know-about-elon-musks-not-so-boring-company-2691709,Everything You Need To Know About Elon Musk's [Not So] Boring Company,Rich Smith,06/17/18,2:58 AM,"['For the past 18 months we\'ve watched in wonder as ""The Boring Company"" evolved from tweet into reality. With each passing day, it\'s sounding more and more like Elon Musk seriously intends to build a company to bore tunnels underground to carry commuter traffic.This article\xa0originally appeared\xa0in The Motley Fool.It all began in December 2016, when Musk posted a (not unprecedented) rant on\xa0Twitter about the difficulty of navigating L.A. traffic, and suggested he could ""build a tunnel boring machine and just start digging.""Within just a few months the rumors began flying: Musk was bidding to build an underground train system for Chicago, to\xa0connect O\'Hare airport with downtown. No, the tunnel would actually be several hundred miles to the east, and would connect New York City to Washington, D.C. Or perhaps it would both a smaller project\xa0 and \xa0farther away — connecting Washington, D.C. to Baltimore via a tunnel running under the Baltimore-Washington Parkway?Rumors and realityWhich of these rumors are true? Potentially,\xa0all of them.In March, the\xa0Chicago Sun-Times reported\xa0that The Boring Company (TBC) had been named one of just two finalists being considered to build a high-speed rail line to connect O\'Hare with downtown — and just this week, it was named the winner. And as regards the D.C. project(s), TBC\xa0has a FAQ\xa0on the Baltimore-Washington expressway project posted on its website, and insists the larger idea of building a Hyperloop connecting Washington to New York City is also still under consideration.Meanwhile, back at the scene of the traffic-crime that started all this discussion — Los Angeles, California — Musk recently held a press conference to discuss progress toward The Boring Company\'s first major dig: a 2.7-mile tunnel underneath and parallel to the traffic-choked Interstate 405. Here\'s what he had to say.Loop vs. HyperloopBefore we go any further, though, it may help to define two related but vastly different terms: ""Loop"" and ""Hyperloop.""Hyperloop is the Musk-musing that first grabbed the attention of mass-transit enthusiasts. In a paper published five years ago, Musk laid out his plan to create a system of above-ground tubes and underground tunnels — all vacuum-sealed —\xa0through which he would electromagnetically shoot pressurized ""pods"" containing passengers\xa0at speeds approaching Mach 1\xa0(768 mph). Musk envisions Hyperloop as a sort of city-connector project, and an alternative to air travel, high-speed rail, and of course highway traffic.Loop is in some ways a less ambitious project — and the focus of\xa0Musk\'s press conference last month. Although utilizing the same kinds of tunnels that could accommodate Hyperloop pods traveling at Mach speed, Loop would be a slower system (about 150 mph), utilizing unpressurized pods running in a not-vacuum-sealed tunnel, and designed for more local transportation needs.Musk describes Loop as a vision for ""personalized mass transit,"" made possible by expanding traffic from the Earth\'s surface, which is thought of largely in two dimensions, into a third dimension — underground.As Musk explained, on any given portion of surface area, there is room for only a finite number of roads. But if it were possible to dig tunnels more cost-effectively than is done today, you could potentially create a system with ""unlimited layers of tunnels,"" sufficient to solve ""any level of traffic"" problems a city might encounter in the foreseeable future. Should one layer of tunnels become congested, a second or third (or fourth, fifth, or 25th) layer could be added beneath it to alleviate roadblocks.Access to these tunnels would be via elevator to and from the surface, with ingress and egress points taking up no more space than needed to accommodate the 16-person pods in which people would travel — about the surface area of a few car-parking spaces. And their small size would mean there\'d be virtually no limit to how many Loop ""stations"" could be built throughout a city — up to and including (eventually, potentially) putting a ""station"" in every homeowner\'s driveway.Safer than you think...""But wait!"" you say. ""Doesn\'t Musk want to do this in California, the earthquake capital of America?"" Well, yes, he is — and that\'s a good thing. As The Boring Company CEO explains — and as experts confirm — when earthquakes strike, it\'s usually actually safer to be in a tunnel\xa0below ground than it is to be on a highway (bridge, or overpass) on the surface.To bolster the point, TBC cites three major earthquakes — the 1985 Mexico City earthquake, 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake in Northern California, and 1994 Northridge earthquake in Los Angeles — in which not only did subway tunnels suffer no damage, but in some cases they served to transport rescue personnel who couldn\'t reach their destinations by way of damaged highways on the surface.""The Source,"" official blog of the Los Angeles Metro transit system,\xa0confirms this: ""Since underground structures move with surrounding soil, the Metro Rail system would not sustain damage or suspend train service in a low-magnitude earthquake. If a stronger earthquake were to occur, the Metro system would likely only experience minor, repairable damage.""There are exceptions of course — when a subway tunnel actually crosses a fault line, for example, tunnel damage would be expected. But as a general rule, in cases other than the crossing of a fault line, tunnels have historically proven safer than highways....But probably more expensive, tooThat\'s a strong argument in favor of Musk\'s tunneling ambitions in L.A. But there\'s still the question of cost to consider. As a general rule, Musk says it costs between $1 million and $4 million per lane-mile to build a highway. In contrast, historically, tunneling has cost closer to\xa0$100 million per mile\xa0— and in some cases, tunnel costs have reached into the billions of dollars per mile.To make tunneling — and Loop, and Hyperloop —\xa0possible, tunneling costs are going to have to go down (if you\'ll pardon the pun).How to drive down costsMuch of Musk\'s talk last week, therefore, focused on the subject of how to drive down the cost of tunneling.One factor is speed. As Musk explains, humans can walk at about three miles per hour. A tunnel boring machine, on the other hand, digs at the rate of about 0.003 miles per hour — 1,000 times slower. Musk\'s objective with The Boring Company, therefore, is to accelerate the speed of tunnel-building by a factor of 10, to 0.03 miles per hour, or about the ""speed"" of a crawling snail. Such an improvement would cut the time to completion of a tunneling project by 50% to 66%, presumably with commensurate improvements in cost.How does he plan to do this? First, by building a better boring machine.TBC began with a modified standard boring machine, nicknamed ""Godot"" (one wonders how long they had to wait for it to be delivered), which TBC used to dig a 0.8-mile test tunnel near SpaceX headquarters. TBC is applying its experience with that test model to create an even more substantially modified boring machine that it calls ""Line-Storm,"" which it expects to dig twice as fast, or even three times as fast, as standard tunnel-borers. Eventually, the plan is to build an entirely internally developed borer, currently code-named ""Prufrock,"" that can dig at rates 10 times or ""aspirationally 15 times faster than current boring machines"" — outracing a snail.This would permit TBC to dig a tunnel from Los Angeles to San Francisco, for example, in just ""a few weeks,"" and to underlay L.A. itself with a network of the hundreds of miles of tunnel that could make Loop a reality.Accomplishing this goal requires multiple incremental advances, none of which are ""rocket science"" according to Musk. For example:Accomplishing this last goal alone, says Musk, could triple or quadruple the speed of digging. Eliminating the cost of waste (""muck"") removal, meanwhile, could cut construction costs by 15% to 20%.What it means to investorsAiming for a near-term 100% to 200% improvement in digging speed, and a further 15% to 20% reduction in costs from waste removal, Elon Musk\'s Boring Company promises to drastically cut the cost of underground construction — much like his reusable rockets at SpaceX have\xa0drastically cut the cost of space travel.Investors, however, currently have even less opportunity to profit from Musk\'s breakthroughs in tunneling technology than they have from his renaissance in rocketry. TBC has attracted $112.5 million in capital to date (in addition to selling $1 million worth of hats and $10 million worth of\xa0not-a-flamethrowers). But according to data from\xa0S&P Global Market Intelligence, 90% of TBC\'s funding has come personally from Elon Musk himself, as the company\'s founder and CEO. The rest was attracted from\xa0qualified individual investors\xa0buying under a Regulation D private placement.For the time being, TBC remains very much Elon Musk\'s pet project. It\'s also not a project of immediate importance to investors, as the tunnel-borer-manufacturing companies TBC will be competing with — firms with names like Terratec, Herrenknecht, and Northern Heavy Industries Group — are all also privately owned. This doesn\'t mean, however, that TBC has\xa0no implications for investors.Over time, should TBC prove successful in drastically reducing the cost of boring, it would open the way to construction of Loops and Hyperloops within and between cities, decreasing the demand for both private automobiles (locally) and commercial airplanes (regionally). Even (much) farther out, a more economical means of boring tunnels should\xa0facilitate mining and colonization\xa0of the Moon, Mars, and the asteroid belt. Musk\'s mentioning that one key to reducing the cost of boring tunnels is reducing their diameter, for example, gets one thinking immediately about an ulterior motive — ensuring that a boring machine can comfortably fit within the payload fairing of a SpaceX rocket.As fast as Musk has moved to turn The Boring Company from a concept into a reality, it could still be a long time before the investing world begins to feel the first tremors of an impact from TBC. That won\'t, however, make it any less interesting of a story to follow.Rich Smith\xa0has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends TSLA and TWTR.

https://www.ibtimes.com/teslas-solar-business-trouble-2691328,Tesla's Solar Business Is In Trouble,Travis Hoium,06/15/18,10:54 AM,"['Investors were caught off guard this week when Elon Musk announced\xa0Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) was\xa0cutting 9% of its workforce\xa0in a move dubbed as a ""companywide restructuring."" What hasn\'t received as much attention is that this looks like another move to\xa0slowly shut down Tesla\'s solar business.\xa0This article originally appeared in The Motley Fool.Tesla has been\xa0shutting down its solar business\xa0since acquiring SolarCity for $2.6 billion in late 2016, and this could accelerate the former industry leader\'s demise. Installations, which peaked at 253 megawatts (MW) in the fourth quarter of 2015, fell to just 76 MW in the first quarter of 2018 and show no signs of recovering. Tesla may be using its layoff announcement to shrink the solar business further, which may have long-term consequences for the broader company.\xa0Solar Is Under Siege At TeslaMusk said in a letter to employees that layoffs would ""not affect our ability to reach Model 3 production targets in the coming months,"" work that\'s primarily being done at Gigafactory 1 in Nevada and its Fremont, California plant. If work at those two factories is picking up pace, but employees are being laid off, it stands to reason the solar side of the business will take the brunt of the layoffs.\xa0As part of the announcement, Musk also said a deal with\xa0Home Depot\xa0would be discontinued only four months after it was launched. which will undoubtedly lead to reduced solar installations. Sales efforts will be moved to Tesla\'s retail showrooms, leveraging existing staff there, but showrooms haven\'t proven to be a good place to sell solar. Again, it looks like solar will be de-emphasized after this week\'s announcement.\xa0Buying SolarCity Could Be A Costly MistakeIf it comes to it, shuttering Tesla\'s solar business wouldn\'t be a trivial matter for the company. Before being acquired by Tesla, SolarCity was given a\xa0$750 million subsidy by the state of New York to build the building now known as Gigafactory 2. But Tesla has to spend $5 billion in the state on solar manufacturing and installation-related activities to keep up its end of the bargain. Here\'s the detail from\xa0Tesla\'s Q1 2018 10-Q filing:\xa0We have an agreement to spend or incur $5.00\xa0billion in combined capital, operational expenses, costs of goods sold and other costs in the State of New York during the 10-year period following full production at Gigafactory\xa02. We anticipate meeting these obligations through our operations at Gigafactory\xa02 and other operations within the State of New York, and we do not believe that we face a significant risk of default.Tesla didn\'t see default as a risk as of when that filing was made, but if its solar business is shrinking, it could be tough to spend $5 billion on solar activities in New York. Defaulting on the terms of the agreement would be costly for Tesla:\xa0If we fail in any year over the course of the term of the agreement to meet these obligations, we would be obligated to pay a ""program payment"" of $41.2 million to the SUNY Foundation in such year. Any inability on our part to comply with the requirements of this agreement may result in the payment of significant amounts to the SUNY Foundation.""Significant amounts"" is vague, but it\'s fair to assume that Tesla would owe the state of New York millions of dollars for its lost investments if it shut down its solar business altogether.\xa0Something Is Wrong With Tesla\'s Solar BusinessIf Tesla\'s solar business was going well,\xa0we would be seeing installations increase (not decrease), and Elon Musk would be touting new solar panels and solar roof tiles coming from Gigafactory 2. Instead, Tesla is announcing layoffs and continues to shrink its solar business, which should be a major concern to investors.\xa0What\'s even more shocking is that competitors aren\'t seeing the same declines in solar as Tesla is.\xa0Sunrun\xa0and\xa0SunPower\xa0have actually used Tesla\'s weakness to grow their residential solar business and increase market share. The fact that Tesla is pulling back in solar indicates that something is wrong with the business. It could be underperforming sales channels, poor solar panel manufacturing, or problems producing the solar roof. Whatever the reason, investors should be concerned that continuing layoffs in Tesla\'s solar business could be extremely costly to the company long-term.\xa0Travis Hoium\xa0owns shares of SunPower.

https://www.ibtimes.com/driverless-tech-will-impact-these-5-industries-2689853,Driverless Tech Will Impact These 5 Industries,Jeremy Bowman,06/12/18,1:27 AM,"['Self-driving vehicles are one of the most anticipated and exciting innovations in the world today.\xa0Driverless cars\xa0seemed like a sci-fi fantasy only a decade ago but they are fast becoming a reality as companies like auto manufacturers, ridesharing services, and tech companies race to develop a safe and reliable autonomous vehicle (AV).This article\xa0originally\xa0appeared\xa0in the Motley Fool.If the autonomous vehicle revolution lives up to the expectations of futurists and forecasters, its effects will be far-reaching. Not only will everyday commuting and transportation be transformed due to the rise of ""mobility as a service"" — as the\xa0driverless revolution\xa0has been called — but a wide range of industries will also be changed for better or worse as they adapt to a world where people can easily move from one destination to another in computerized pods.Just as\xa0the cloud\xa0has led to the transition of computing as a scalable service rather than a concrete product like hardware, analysts see a similar evolution with self-driving cars. As autonomous vehicle technology advances, commuters and others (especially in cities) are expected to no longer need their own cars and can rely on a fleet of driverless vehicles to ferry them to and from work, home, or wherever they need to go. Since the biggest cost today of ridesharing services like Uber is the driver, eliminating that will make such rides vastly cheaper, therefore making the comparative expense of owning a car untenable for many.Among the industries that will be most clearly impacted are auto manufacturers and ridesharing services, but also insurance companies will bear a burden since car crashes are expected to decline. Gas stations, airlines, and hotels are all connected to the transportation industry and will be changed as well. Manufacturing costs for cars will increase due to the quantity and cost of the technology necessary in AVs, meaning that potentially car ownership will decline.We\'ll examine how these and other industries will be affected by the proliferation of driverless technology, but first let\'s take a look at where driverless technology is today,\xa0its potential\xa0and the challenges it faces, as well as the other key aspects investors should understand.For the sake of our discussion, a driverless car is defined as a vehicle that can operate itself without human input through a network of sensors including cameras, radar, lasers, and other technologies.A brief history of self-driving carsTo a degree, autonomous vehicle (AV) technology has existed in a diluted form for a while. Cruise control has been a standard option for decades, and other features like cameras to assist with parallel parking or blind spot detection have become common in new vehicles, making the driving experience more automated.Today, autonomous driving has become a reality on controlled tracks and other such environments. A number of states have begun allowing AV testing on public roads. California, which is home to AV leaders like\xa0Alphabet\xa0(NASDAQ:GOOG)\xa0(NASDAQ:GOOGL),Tesla\xa0(NASDAQ:TSLA), and private ridesharing company Uber recently moved to allow AVs on its roads without a driver.Driverless vehicles have also been tested in a number of states and cities including Arizona, where the weather is easy on driving, and Pittsburgh, which Uber chose due to its challenging terrain.\xa0However, autonomous vehicles have yet to make a full transition to everyday use in all types of weather and traffic situations where they would have to react to sudden surprises.AVs use a combination of technologies such as computer vision, made up of a network of cameras that can detect objects to the front, back, and to the side of a car,\xa0radar, and\xa0LiDAR\xa0— a system that works similarly to radar but uses light from a series of lasers to detect nearby objects.The information received by the cameras and LiDAR gets overlaid with mapping technology to direct the car and plan the best route available. AVs can also predict the moves of other cars, enhancing safety. Autonomous vehicles can learn to predict behaviors of other automobiles and pedestrians by using\xa0artificial intelligence\xa0and\xa0machine learning. Through repeated observations and modeling, the software behind the autonomous vehicle can develop a data set that allows it\xa0to extrapolate the most likely moves of other vehicles on the road based on what it has recorded in the past. As more AVs take to the road, the technology will become even safer since they will be able to communicate with one another, and will not have to worry about the variance of human error.The industry uses a\xa0five-level scale\xa0to measure autonomous vehicle capabilities.Today, autonomous vehicles on the road are somewhere between level two and level three. Since these vehicles rely on connected software to program them, an example of the\xa0Internet of Things,\xa0companies like Tesla can easily upload the latest upgrades for its customers, making it easier for the technology to advance. The automaker says that its vehicles ""regularly receives over-the-air software updates that add new features and functionality,"" a notable difference from traditional cars.Opportunities and challengesIt\'s hard to understate the\xa0opportunity of the driverless economy.\xa0Intel\xa0(NASDAQ:INTC)\xa0— which has gained a strong position in autonomous vehicles thanks to its\xa0acquisition of Mobileye\xa0— and research firm Strategy Analytics predicted that in the years 2035-2045, 585,000 lives\xa0would be saved\xa0by AV technology, $234 billion in public safety costs would be cut, and 250 million commuter hours annually would be saved. They also predicted that the passenger economy would be worth $7 trillion by 2050.By remaking transportation and the way space is used — especially in cities — the effects of autonomous vehicles will be far-reaching, bearing consequences well beyond carmakers and the technology companies that are developing software for AVs. For instance, parking lots could be repurposed as parks, solar farms, retail spaces, apartments, or any of a number of ways that are more environmentally friendly and useful than a paved parking lot. Similarly, on-street parking can also be removed to create more room for traffic flow, bike lanes, sidewalks, or greenery.Still, there are plenty of obstacles to a future where autonomous vehicles are the norm. The response to a\xa0recent Uber crash\xa0shows one such risk. After a self-driving Uber killed a pedestrian in Tempe, Arizona, there have been\xa0calls to slow down\xa0the spread of autonomous vehicles until there was a greater assurance of safety.\xa0While experts believe that AVs will be safer than human-driven vehicles, the\xa0general public may need more persuasion\xa0for now as there will almost certainly be more accidents like this one.Regulatory barriers\xa0may also delay the advance of autonomous vehicles.\xa0Legal concerns\xa0about who would be at fault in an accident abound as regulators are just starting to address the myriad of liability issues that would emanate from self-driving car usage. A group of senators recently asked autonomous vehicle makers to clarify their position on such lawsuits.    An engineer points to a Huawei Mate 10 Pro mobile used to control a driverless car during the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Feb. 26, 2018.  Photo: REUTERS/Yves Herman  In some states, progress is moving more slowly than expected. GM said in October 2017 that the company expected to test an autonomous ridesharing service on the streets of Manhattan by early 2018. However, more than six months after applying for a permit, the carmaker is still waiting for a final approval from the state.\xa0Following the Uber crash, regulators may be more wary of testing such vehicles in an uncontrolled, high-risk environment, and regulations will likely delay the technology\'s full deployment.Still, the effects of the AV revolution are already beginning to be felt in a multitude of industries. Let\'s take a look at the sectors that can expect the most impact from the rise of driverless cars.1. Auto manufacturersNo industry will be more impacted by self-driving than the automakers themselves. Already, traditional automakers are jockeying for position. General Motors has made several acquisitions to beef up its autonomous pipeline including Cruise Automation, an AV-tech start-up, and Strobe, a LiDAR manufacturer.\xa0Based on GM\'s plans to deploy a self-driving ridesharing service\xa0as soon as 2019, the Chevy maker seems to be making considerable progress in the AV race.Ford\xa0(NYSE:F), meanwhile, recently said it would deploy AVs in a test in Miami,\xa0and the company plans to have fully autonomous vehicles in operation by 2021.\xa0However, based on the\xa0valuations\xa0— both Ford and General Motors command\xa0price-to-earnings ratios\xa0around 6 —\xa0for traditional automakers, investors seem to be taking a dim view of their prospects. Investors are awarding much richer valuations on younger companies like Tesla and Uber.Investors should note that several factors influence P/E ratios and in the case of Ford and GM, they are also low because of\xa0fears that the auto cycle is reaching its peak.No one knows exactly what effect self-driving cars will have on traditional automakers, and that will depend on the speed and the extent that consumers embrace AVs and how quickly traditional auto manufacturers can develop and incorporate the technology.However, the conventional wisdom is that auto manufacturers could be among the losers for a couple of key reasons:That being said, tech companies such as Alphabet, have said it would focus on the technology itself and leave the car manufacturing to the experts. It has partnered with Chrysler to develop a ridesharing service that could hit streets as early as this year. Uber has partnered with a range of automakers including\xa0Volvo,\xa0Toyota, and\xa0Daimler.Only Tesla has emerged as a legitimate competitor to the big three, and Apple is rumored to be developing its own electric car, which could evolve to have self-driving capabilities over time.\xa0\xa0With the proliferation of self-driving cars, fewer American city dwellers are likely to own their own vehicles as it will, in theory, be so easy to hail one from an autonomous ridesharing service.Despite this, the rate with which Americans will give up car ownership may be exaggerated as drivers — especially those in suburban and rural parts of the country — are used to the current model of car ownership and for many owning a car may be more of an emotional decision.In fact, the AV market could be an opportunity for automakers as it could expand the market for cars. Self-driving vehicles are likely to take share from other modes of transportation like trains, subways, buses, and even air travel,\xa0\xa0and it should grow the number of vehicle miles traveled.By alleviating traffic, parking, and the need for actually driving using AVs will become more attractive than other forms of transportation. That should be a boon for car-makers as they can either operate their own self-driving ridesharing fleets or sell vehicles to other operators if individual car ownership declines. Considering their ability to manufacture cars at scale, they will likely have an advantage over competitors like Uber in operating self-driving ridesharing services.2. Auto insuranceAuto insurance is big business. The American auto insurance market is worth $200 billion today based on annual sales, but if AVs are successful in significantly reducing the number of accidents, the need for auto insurance will decline.Currently, about 90 percent of accidents are estimated to be caused at least in part by human error, but with the elimination of a human element in the driving process, the burden for carrying insurance will be shifted to the fleet owner (in the event of ridesharing services) or manufacturer instead of the driver. Since those companies will have more negotiating power, many may be able to get lower rates or self-insure. In 2017, the average insurance cost for a medium sedan was $1,202, another factor that could accelerate adoption of driverless cars.\xa0The accounting firm KPMG predicted that the insurance market will shrink 70 percent by 2050, losing $137 billion of its value.Warren Buffett, whose\xa0Berkshire Hathaway\xa0(NYSE:BRK-A)\xa0(NYSE:BRK-B)\xa0conglomerate owns the auto insurer GEICO as well as other insurance companies,\xa0acknowledged\xa0that self-driving cars would hurt the industry. Buffett told\xa0CNBC, ""If they\'re safer, there\'s less in the way of insurance costs, [and] that brings down premiums significantly.""Insurers like\xa0Progressive\xa0and\xa0Allstate\xa0are also likely to suffer as the accident rate declines. Since insurance prices are based in part on accident rates — as the money insurers collect is paid out to cover damages and claims from accidents — prices will fall as accident rates go down since insurance is a competitive market with a number of companies fighting for drivers\' business.3. Ridesharing/TaxisRidesharing services like Uber and Lyft have already had a significant impact on urban transportation. The value of taxi medallions in major cities has plummeted as regulated taxis no longer have a monopoly now that consumers can hail rides with an app.Shares of\xa0Medallion Financial, which invests in and owns taxi medallions, have fallen by nearly three-quarters since 2013, and the price of a New York taxi medallion has dropped from about $1 million in 2013 to less than $200,000 last year.With the rise of self-driving cars, the ridesharing industry is\xa0about to be disrupted again. Companies like Uber and Lyft have been aggressively working to develop a viable autonomous vehicle or to partner with carmakers that can do so as there are obvious benefits for the companies.In the current ridesharing business model, the driver (and their car) accounts for an estimated 75\xa0percent of the cost of the ride so eliminating the driver would make ridesharing significantly cheaper. That would likely expand the market as many rides could become less expensive than typical public transportation fare.Although Uber and Lyft are the current ridesharing leaders they may not be the winners in the driverless ridesharing market. Those companies\' biggest strengths may be the thousands of drivers they employ as it takes time to build up such a base of contractors. However, with AVs ascendants, those drivers may be rendered obsolete.On the other hand, Uber and Lyft are jockeying for positions in the new self-driving car market with partnerships with automakers and by developing their own AV technology. Uber also acquired Otto, an AV tech company that makes retrofitting kits that allow conventional vehicles to become self-driving, signaling a potential opportunity for their contractors to turn their traditional vehicles into self-driving vehicles and use them to go and pick up rides and make money while they don\'t need them.For competitors wanting to access this market, there are other significant barriers to entry such as mapping technology, an app, and making consumers aware of your service. Brand recognition may be Uber and Lyfts\' biggest advantage for now.In one key area, however, traditional automakers may have the edge: Pricing. Car manufacturers like GM can build their own vehicles and can operate their own ridesharing services at lower costs. If GM can provide a cheaper ride than Uber because it doesn\'t have to split its revenue with drivers/the vehicle owners, then consumers are sure to flock to its service.Either way, the ridesharing industry is about to get more competitive, and facing off against profit machines like GM and Ford with more access to capital won\'t be easy. However, for now, brand recognition and a contractor base in the tens of thousands are discernible advantages for the ridesharing companies.4. Gas stations/Convenience stores\xa0A world full of self-driving vehicles could eventually mean a world where people no longer have to fill up their gas tanks themselves. Since autonomous vehicles will be able to operate themselves without any passengers, the cars will eventually be able to fill themselves up on breaks like late at night when no one needs them. That, along with the rise of\xa0electric-powered vehicles, which will force gas stations to add chargers, is likely to weigh on gas stations and convenience store chains that rely on customers stopping in to pick a coffee or sandwich when they\'re putting gas in their car.Because drivers will no longer be pumping gas themselves, gas stations won\'t be needed at major intersections and fueling and recharging will likely take a place in out of the way locations where real estate is less expensive.Some of the publicly traded gas station/convenience stores that are likely to suffer include\xa0Casey\'s General Stores, which makes the vast majority of its gross profit from items like grocery and prepared food, but relies on traffic from people refueling. Similarly, truck-stop chains like\xa0TravelPlaza\xa0will also face challenges as trucks become automated, meaning drivers no longer need to stop at roadside service centers for a hot meal or a shower.However, some observers believe the spread of AVs could be boon for convenience stores as long-distance trips will become more popular and replace air travel. Even if the nature of filling stations change, passengers will still need to stop to use the bathroom or to get something to eat or drink, so it remains to be seen if business at roadside convenience stores could increase.Warren Buffett finds himself on that side of the bet as he took a 38.1\xa0percent stake in Pilot/Flying J, which will turn into a majority stake five years from now. With the move, Buffett\xa0is signaling\xa0that he believes the effects of the coming EV and AV revolutions have been exaggerated, saying at the time of the deal, ""We don\'t buy businesses to change them.""5. Hotels/AirlinesFinally, the spread of self-driving cars is likely to have a significant impact on the broader travel and tourism industry, specifically airlines and hotels.Since autonomous vehicles should make transportation cheaper, faster, and easier, it will likely encourage more weekend trips to nearby destinations, allowing travelers to effortlessly zip to a city, beach, ski area, or another popular spot that\'s within a few hours. More travelers and increased tourism should be a boon for hotels and companies like Airbnb that also provide lodging. Even restaurants could benefit from more frequent travel.Years of consolidation in the hotel industry have essentially turned it into an oligopoly led by\xa0Marriott,\xa0Hilton, and\xa0Intercontinental Hotels Group, all of which could benefit from the rise of AVs as they have thousands of hotels in popular locales that should see an increase in demand as traveling gets easier.However, the rise of autonomous vehicles will likely be a negative for roadside motels, which sprung up specifically to accommodate travelers en route to a destination, rather than at the destination itself. Since AVs don\'t require anyone to drive them, travelers may just choose to sleep through the night in such a vehicle in order to get to their destination faster, rather than stopping at a motel to rest in a bed. Car-makers, for instance, believe that car interiors will have multiple modes, according to the passengers\' need at the time, such as sleep mode that would allow the seats to recline, or meeting mode where the seats all face each other. As such needs become more specialized, it\'s also possible that cars/buses will be designed specifically for overnight trips, much in that way that sleeper cars exist on trains, further obviating the need for roadside motels.Similarly, autonomous vehicles will become convenient substitutes for short-haul trips on airlines. For instance, it would be easy enough to travel overnight in an AV from New York to Chicago, and AV passengers can avoid the hassles of air travel such as getting to and from the airport and getting through security. Airlines like\xa0Southwest, which only serves the domestic market could suffer as a result, or will be forced to improve their service to compete.A fundamental shift in travelBeyond these five, many other industries will be affected. For example, the need for parking spaces will be gradually relieved, which will also affect the way real estate is used; long-haul trucking will become more efficient which could put pressure on railroads;\xa0more cellular data and entertainment services like\xa0Netflix\xa0will\xa0be consumed during car trips; package and food delivery will become more efficient and cheaper, accelerating the growth of restaurant delivery and e-commerce; driving schools will become obsolete; and the demand for auto parts could be transferred to tech companies rather than traditional parts-makers (though some believe increased wear-and-tear vehicle miles could boost traditional parts-makers).Like the internet, the driverless car revolution will remake vast swaths of the global economy in ways not yet foreseen, but for investors, the five spaces above are likely to see the greatest amount of upheaval and because of that, they will present the greatest opportunity.Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool’s board of directors.\xa0Jeremy Bowman owns shares of General Motors and Netflix.

https://www.ibtimes.com/teslas-energy-storage-business-surging-2688256,Tesla's Energy Storage Business Is Surging,Daniel Sparks,06/07/18,1:57 AM,"['Tesla\xa0(NASDAQ:TSLA)\xa0CEO Elon Musk\'s update on the electric-car maker\'s business Tuesday afternoon at the company\'s annual shareholder meeting obviously impressed investors. The stock\xa0surged higher\xa0Wednesday, finishing the trading day up nearly 10 percent.This article\xa0originally\xa0appeared\xa0in the Motley Fool.For the most part, headlines after the meeting seemed focused on Musk confirming\xa0the automaker is on track with its\xa0production and profitability plans. Of course, there\'s good reason to believe the news that Tesla is on track to achieve a production rate for its Model 3 of 5,000 units per week by the end of June and GAAP profitability in both Q3 and Q4. Production delays have previously plagued the Model 3 as Tesla attempts to transform into a mass-market auto company, which has weighed on profitability. But another narrative discussed during the shareholder meeting is worth examining: Tesla\'s surging energy storage business.What Musk said about Tesla\'s energy storage businessMusk was extremely optimistic about Tesla\'s energy storage business, implying energy storage sales will see wild growth at rates that exceed the\xa0sharp growth in Tesla\'s vehicles sales.Launched\xa0just three years ago, its energy storage business has already swelled to a total of 1 gigawatt-hours of energy storage deployments globally as of May, Musk said during the shareholder meeting. He also said he expects that in ""less than a year from now"" Tesla will deploy another GWh of energy storage.But this is just the beginning, according to Musk. ""I think for many years to come, each incremental year will be about as much as all of the preceding years [in terms of energy storage deployments],"" the CEO predicted.Furthermore, he said deployments are ultimately limited by production, which is notable since Tesla\'s Gigafactory has morphed into the world\'s highest-volume battery factory when measured by battery capacity output.Musk put the extraordinary demand for energy storage and the scale of the Gigafactory\'s output into perspective:We would actually be able to do more if we could produce more. And we are producing a lot of batteries. So in fact, next quarter, at the Gigafactory, we expect to make more battery capacity than all other EVs combined worldwide, including China. So I mean, this is a really crazy amount of batteries. This one factory is making — will make more than all the other factories on earth...Building momentumOf course, sharp growth in Tesla\'s energy storage business isn\'t a new development. In the company\'s first-quarter update, Tesla said energy storage deployments were up 161\xa0percent sequentially to 373 megawatt-hours, helped by a utility-scale project that was 129 megawatt-hours by itself.""Electric utilities and power producers around the globe are increasingly appreciating the value proposition of our Powerpack storage systems based not only on economic benefits but also on the operational benefits of faster response time and greater reliability of the electric grid,"" Tesla said about its energy storage business in its first-quarter shareholder letter.In addition, even though Tesla deployed a record number of its residential Powerwall energy storage systems during the quarter, its backlog for the product continued to grow.With such rapid growth in energy storage deployments, Tesla\'s energy generation and storage segment (which also includes sales from Tesla\'s solar business) saw revenue soar 92 percent year over year in Q1 to $410 million, accounting for 12 percent of Tesla\'s total revenue. With Tesla expecting its energy storage deployments for the full year to be three times higher than deployments in 2017, and considering Musk\'s optimistic outlook for long-term energy storage deployments, energy storage looks poised to be a meaningful catalyst for years to come.Daniel Sparks\xa0owns shares of Tesla.

https://www.ibtimes.com/rise-electric-or-hydrogen-fuel-cell-semi-truck-not-so-fast-2685588,Rise of Electric (Or Hydrogen Fuel Cell) Semi Truck? Not So Fast,Maxx Chatsko,05/30/18,1:55 AM,"['In November 2017,\xa0Tesla\'s\xa0(NASDAQ:TSLA)\xa0Elon Musk unveiled the Tesla Semi to much fanfare. It sparked a discussion about the transformative potential to electrify long-haul trucking. Transportation is responsible for 27 percent of America\'s total carbon emissions, and medium- and heavy-duty trucks account for 23 percent of transportation\'s total carbon output. Replace diesels with zero-emission engines, and you\'d drop U.S. carbon emissions over 6 percent.This article\xa0originally\xa0appeared\xa0in the Motley Fool.Doing the math is one thing. Putting innovative trucks onto the highway is another. The reality is that the Tesla Semi is still years away from hitting the road — and the same goes for rival Nikola Motors\' hydrogen-electric semi trucks, led by the Nikola One.But there\'s another heavy-duty truck strategy, with near-zero emissions, that\'s flying way under the radar. That\'s a bit unusual considering, unlike Tesla and Nikola, the first dozen or so trucks using the new technology — powered by natural gas — are already in the hands of customers.The engines have a larger market opportunity in the near term than either electric semi. They just received backing from an oil supermajor, and might be key to the near- and long-term future of natural-gas fuels supplier\xa0Clean Energy Fuels\xa0(NASDAQ:CLNE). Can the natural gas consortium beat out the hyped-up semi offerings from Tesla and Nikola Motors?Are natural gas engines the next big thing?The near-zero natural gas engines were created by a joint venture between\xa0Cummins\xa0(NYSE:CMI)\xa0and\xa0Westport Fuel Systems\xa0(NASDAQ:WPRT), called Cummins Westport. Unveiled on May 1, the engine lineup can be used in medium- and heavy-duty trucks, including buses, refuse vehicles, and long-haul trucks. In fact, the ISX 12N engine, as it is called, is the world\'s first Class 8\xa0on-highway truck engine to be certified near-zero by the California Air Resources Board, which sets emission standards that are followed by 16 other states. The Tesla Semi and Nikola One are both Class 8 vehicles, or what most people refer to as semis.What does ""near zero"" mean, exactly? When powered by renewable natural gas (RNG), or natural gas sourced from landfills or other biological means, the engines produce life cycle emissions equivalent to a 100\xa0percent battery electric engine of similar size powered by a natural gas power plant.Cummins Westport has offered other near-zero engines for several years, but none as powerful as the ISX 12N. Therefore, it rebranded its previous lineup with new names and its ""Move to Zero"" marketing campaign. It also launched after delivering the first engine to a customer, AJR Trucking, which will\xa0soon have 20 total in its possession.The business model relies on a simple idea: Natural gas engines can be put into existing trucks and refueled with existing natural gas fuel infrastructure — much more easily than an electric or hydrogen fuel cell truck could.\xa0They provide an economic way to meet stringent new emissions standards being slapped onto the trucking industry. That\'s especially true in the State of California. Considering that electric semis aren\'t available to meet today\'s regulations, trucking fleets may turn to natural gas instead.It\'s no surprise, then, that ISX 12N engines are expected to gain traction quickly in the state. That\'ll be a lot easier considering Clean Energy Fuels has built out a robust network of refueling stations in California. It is the largest supplier of RNG in the nation and sold a total of 351 million gasoline-gallon equivalents of natural gas transportation fuels in all of 2017.It\'ll be even easier for the trucking industry to transition to natural gas after French energy giant\xa0Total SA\xa0purchased a $25 million stake in Clean Energy Fuels. More important, Total will provide $100 million to jump-start a new leasing program helping diesel fleet owners switch to natural gas engines. That could put up to\xa0$450 million in natural gas heavy-duty trucks\xa0on the highway — all using the refueling infrastructure of Clean Energy Fuels and adding demand of up to 50 million gallons per year.That should provide a big boost to the technology, but questions remain: Do fleet owners have any incentive to wait for electric semis? What about all of those orders for Tesla and Nikola Motors?Electric, hydrogen, or natural gas?There are some notable differences among the three alternative-fuel semi trucks.First is the fact that Tesla and Nikola Motors are selling the entire truck, whereas Cummins Westport is selling a lineup of engines. That\'s a testament to the more-mature technology ecosystem for combustion engines compared to electric modes of transportation. And it should make it easier for the natural gas engine (and natural gas semi trucks) to gain traction in the near term.Second is the market opportunity. Although the Tesla Semi and Nikola One are hyped as the next big thing in heavy-duty trucking,\xa0limitations imposed by cost\xa0and refueling infrastructure mean they\'ll be able to serve only a small part of the North American trucking fleet. That is, electric semis will work best for fleets with predetermined routes — like from a production facility to a warehouse or airport. That\'s why nearly all orders announced to date are from companies like\xa0Anheuser-Busch,\xa0UPS,\xa0PepsiCo, and the like.The near-zero engine lineup from Cummins Westport doesn\'t face the same daunting limitations. They\'re more expensive than diesel, but less costly than electric semis. Natural gas trucks don\'t have the same robust refueling infrastructure as diesel, but fleet owners have a buffet compared to electric charging stations. That means natural gas heavy-duty trucks are better suited to capture more of the overall trucking market — and they have a huge lead when it comes to market launch.The main takeaway is this: Replacing diesel power with alternative fuels won\'t be easy, as there are always trade-offs. When it comes to cost and availability in 2018, however, natural gas engines are the clear (and only) choice for fleet owners looking to ditch diesel.Let\'s not get too carried awayWill electric and hydrogen-electric semis have a place in the future of long-haul trucking? Absolutely. But while it\'s fun to dream with numbers, it\'s important to remember the long arc of technology commercialization. Electric and fuel-cell semis are, at best, years away from hitting the highway en masse. And even when they do, they\'ll encounter economic hurdles that will limit their market opportunity.That leaves natural gas trucks as the best near-term strategy for fleet owners looking (or being forced) to move away from diesel. Whether they ""move to zero"" or not remains to be seen, but investors may get the answer in the next year or two by following ISX 12N engine sales data.Maxx Chatsko\xa0has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

https://www.ibtimes.com/how-ford-german-automakers-are-bridging-tesla-moat-2684394,How Ford And The German Automakers Are Bridging A Tesla 'Moat',John Rosevear,05/25/18,3:38 AM,"['Tesla\xa0(NASDAQ:TSLA)\xa0fans say that the company\'s Superchargers, a global network of fast-charging stations, provide a key advantage that the big automakers can\'t match.This article originally appeared in the Motley Fool.The Superchargers, the thinking goes, give Tesla owners the ability to drive anywhere, just as they could with an internal-combustion vehicle, while drivers of other electric vehicles are stuck using chargers that are usually much slower, and often hard to find.It\'s true that the Supercharger network has helped Tesla convince lots of customers to ""go electric."" But it\'s also true that there\'s nothing stopping the big automakers from building their own fast-charging network.That\'s now happening in Europe, and it\'s a model for how a network could be built in the United States as well.Meet Ionity, a fast-charging joint ventureIonity, a German company\xa0formed late last year, has begun the process of building a network of fast-charging stations across Europe. It\'s a joint venture between\xa0Ford Motor Company\xa0(NYSE:F), Mercedes-Benz parent\xa0Daimler AG\xa0(NASDAQOTH:DDAIF),\xa0BMW AG(NASDAQOTH:BAMXF), and\xa0Volkswagen AG\xa0(NASDAQOTH:VLKAY)\xa0together with its subsidiaries Porsche and\xa0Audi.Those four automakers together accounted for about 47% of the vehicles sold in Europe in 2017 -- and a much larger share of the upscale and luxury markets in the region.Ionity plans to build about 400 high-speed fast-charging stations along European highways by the end of 2020. The stations will be about 120 kilometers (roughly 75 miles) apart, close enough to support even shorter-range electric vehicles. (For comparison, Tesla\'s site currently lists 394 Supercharger stations in Europe, and another 159 ""coming soon."")Ionity\'s stations will use the CCS (Combined Charging System) DC Fast standard, which has become the default charging standard for most automakers (other than Tesla) in Europe and the United States. (Its principal rival is the ChaDeMo standard used by Japanese automakers, including\xa0Nissan.)Ionity\'s stations will support charging capacity up to 350 kilowatts, very fast and more than any current vehicle can use. The intent is to make it high enough to support most vehicles under development or likely to be introduced in the future. (Ionity is branding its ultra-fast CCS chargers as ""High-Power Charging,"" or HPC.)This isn\'t just a hypothetical plan. Ionity has already secured sites in 19 European countries, and it opened its first station in Germany in April. It plans to have about 100 stations operational by the end of this year. The stations designed by Designworks feature distinctive branding and chargers that aim to make them as easily recognized by drivers as gas stations are now.Will they be free like Superchargers?Ionity\'s chargers won\'t be free to use (though chargers at its first station in Germany are free until the end of May.) But Tesla\'s aren\'t really ""free"" anymore, either.When they were first introduced, Superchargers were free for Tesla owners to use with no limits, but the company has gradually changed that. Right now, Model S and Model X owners get 400 kilowatt-hours (kWh) of free charging a year, which Tesla says is enough to drive about 1,000 miles. Above that limit, there\'s now a fee, although Electrek\xa0reported\xa0that Tesla waived it for many Model S and Model X owners in 2017, and it may be waived permanently for owners who used a referral code to buy their cars.Model 3 owners always pay a fee to use the Superchargers.Why are these automakers backing Ionity?All six (counting the VW subsidiaries) have significant electric-vehicle development programs under way now. The thinking behind the joint venture is that European consumers are likely to readily adopt electric vehicles once they\'re available in significant numbers -- if the infrastructure to support them exists. Fuel prices are high in Europe, and public concern about pollution from internal-combustion engines has been rising in the wake of VW\'s diesel-emissions cheating scandal.Ionity and the automakers backing it all say that they will welcome other automakers who wish to invest in the venture. Ionity has said clearly that its stations will be brand-agnostic.Even Teslas can use them, if and when Tesla makes a CCS adapter available.Could something like Ionity work in the United States?Ionity is clearly a serious, credible, and well-funded effort. With roughly 400 stations planned, its network will be about the same size that Tesla\'s is today, and sufficient to support road trips throughout much of Europe.What about the United States? While several private companies are working to build high-speed charging stations here, including one funded by Volkswagen as a condition of its Dieselgate settlement, a joint venture funded by automakers would give the effort a major boost. If and when the United States looks ripe for widespread electric-vehicle adoption -- which it arguably doesn\'t under the current administration -- it\'s very possible we\'ll see something similar here.The upshot: The Superchargers won\'t be\xa0a moat for TeslaHere\'s the big takeaway, for investors in Tesla and other electric-vehicle efforts: While Tesla\'s Supercharger network gives the company an advantage now, it\'s not a moat -- and at least in Europe, efforts to create a viable rival network are already well under way.John Rosevear\xa0owns shares of Ford.

https://www.ibtimes.com/californias-solar-mandate-could-be-2-billion-windfall-solar-industry-2682596,California's Solar Mandate Could Be A $2 Billion Windfall For The Solar Industry,Travis Hoium,05/20/18,3:28 AM,"[""California's Energy Commission has officially made solar mandatory for new homes built after 2020. This gives the solar industry a new guaranteed market of about 222 megawatts (MW) per year, according to GTM Research (now Wood Mackenzie, a subsidiary of\xa0Verisk Analytics). In other words, California's new home construction alone could account for about 10% of all of the residential solar installed in the U.S., based on 2017 installation levels.The article\xa0originally appeared\xa0in Motley Fool.Recent updates to\xa0GTM Research's projections\xa0show an incremental benefit for the residential solar industry of about 650 MW between 2020 and 2023, which could be worth $2 billion for the industry. That should be great for the fortunes of solar companies with exposure to the state.Why this mandate is a big dealNew homes were always more likely to have solar than old homes in California, but only about 20% of new homes actually had solar installed. With 75,000 to 100,000 new homes being built each year, there could be as much as 400 MW of incremental demand growth, assuming an average solar system size of 5 kW.GTM Research takes a slightly more conservative approach and only estimates 222 MW of total new-build solar in California in 2020, with 900 MW total installed between 2020 and 2023. But 650 MW will be incremental new demand from this law, which at an average cost of $3 per watt would be worth $1.95 billion to the solar industry.Expanding the pool for everyoneSunrun\xa0(NASDAQ:RUN),\xa0Vivint Solar\xa0(NYSE:VSLR), and\xa0Tesla\xa0(NASDAQ:TSLA)\xa0are the\xa0three biggest solar installers in the U.S., and they're likely to see an incremental boost in demand. Expanding the pool in any way is good news because residential solar installations were down 16% in 2017, and it's getting harder to find new solar customers. Tesla has taken the brunt of the decline, shrinking installations in the first quarter of 2018 by 49% versus a year ago. Sunrun's installations fell 7% to 68 MW, and Vivint Solar's dropped 12% to 40.4 MW. All installers would love a new source of consistent demand.One product that will be interesting to watch is\xa0Tesla's solar roof, which makes a lot of sense on new homes (rather than in retrofits of old homes). New roofs could be designed to incorporate the solar roof, maximizing the number of active solar tiles and improving energy production. This would also give Tesla a consistent source of demand.The king of new-construction solar energyIt's easy to see how the winners from a residential solar mandate would be the biggest residential solar installers in the country. But it's\xa0SunPower\xa0(NASDAQ:SPWR)\xa0that has a leg up in solar for new construction. The company has partnered with 13 of the top 16 homebuilders in California, and its premium solar panels fit well with the same target market as buyers of newly constructed homes, who are more likely to have disposable income for a premium product.According to SunPower, it has installed solar on over 30,000 new homes in over 1,000 communities since 2005. It may be a surprising choice, but if I had to choose one winner in California's new-home solar boom, SunPower would be it. Still, given the decline in installations recently, all solar installers will take a guaranteed source of demand.Travis Hoium\xa0owns shares of SunPower.

https://www.ibtimes.com/tesla-earnings-preview-elon-musk-has-lot-explaining-do-2676441,Tesla Earnings Preview: Elon Musk Has A Lot Of Explaining To Do,Adam Levine-Weinberg,04/30/18,1:23 AM,"[""Elon Musk's hubris has come back to bite him -- and\xa0Tesla\xa0(NASDAQ:TSLA)\xa0shareholders -- yet again.Less than three months ago, Musk devoted a substantial part of Tesla's Q4 earnings call to talk about plans for\xa0massive automation\xa0of the vehicle manufacturing process. (This plan flew in the face of decades of industry experience and management theory.) Musk even said that Tesla's factory and production process, rather than its brand or vehicle designs, would be its long-term competitive advantage.This article\xa0originally appeared\xa0in the Motley Fool.It didn't take long for reality to set in. Tesla missed its production target again in Q1 -- partly due to the questionable decision to introduce so much automation. Furthermore, the company's plan to get production back on track by the end of this quarter could easily backfire -- with unfortunate consequences for Tesla.A disappointing quarterTwo years ago, Tesla began taking reservations for the Model 3 sedan -- its most affordable vehicle yet. It quickly amassed hundreds of thousands of reservations. For the past year, Tesla's main objective has been to smoothly launch and ramp up production of the Model 3.In the fourth quarter, Tesla delivered just 1,550 Model 3s. However, by the beginning of January, Model 3 production had reached a rate equivalent to more than 1,000 vehicles per week. Furthermore, in early February, management predicted that output would reach 2,500 units per week by the end of March.Tesla fell short of that target. In the seven-day period ending on April 2, Tesla produced 2,020 Model 3s. More importantly, it built only 9,766 Model 3 vehicles during the entire quarter -- an average of 751 per week.This makes it clear that the production pace for the last few days of the fourth quarter was\xa0just a gimmick\xa0-- as was the production rate at the end of March. Rather than smoothly ramping up production, Tesla has focused on maximizing output in the last week of each quarter in order to show off for investors. Meanwhile, its sustainable production rate has lagged far behind.Elon Musk is asking for more troubleIn an interview earlier this month, Musk acknowledged that overreliance on robots rather than trained workers was a major cause of Tesla's recent production shortfalls. This casts doubt on the company's ability to meet its previous output goals, as those relied on increasing automation.Additionally, Musk continues to pursue artificial production goals for the last week of each quarter rather than maximizing overall output. He recently set a goal of achieving a production rate equivalent to 6,000 vehicles per week (via Electrek) across Tesla's full Model 3 production apparatus and supply chain by June 30. The idea is to provide a margin of error so that Tesla can ensure that it hits its official target of building 5,000 Model 3s per week by the end of June.Musk acknowledged that it would take several additional months for Tesla to be able to churn out 6,000 Model 3s per week on a sustainable basis. However, even that estimate might be too optimistic.It's one thing to get a part of the production system moving at a particular speed for a day or a week. This can potentially be accomplished by adding overtime (or extra staff) and stockpiling parts or raw materials. The result is that extra production in the day or week being measured comes at the expense of output during the rest of the quarter. It's far more difficult to get the entire company and its supply chain to raise production in a coordinated, sustainable fashion.Yes, it really mattersSome investors may believe that it doesn't matter whether Tesla achieves a sustainable Model 3 production rate of 5,000 vehicles per week in three months or six months.However, Tesla ended 2017 with just $5.4 billion of liquidity. It is likely to burn through billions of dollars of cash this year, and the slower Model 3 production ramps up, the worse that cash burn will be. This could potentially force the company to issue more stock or debt on unfavorable terms.Tesla's production woes will also interfere with its ability to reduce the cost to build each Model 3. That could force it to further delay selling the $35,000 base model, which price-conscious buyers have been waiting for. By the time the $35,000 version becomes widely available, the $7,500 U.S. federal tax credit for Tesla purchases will probably have started to phase out. As a result, some of these price-conscious consumers might never end up buying a Model 3.Thus, Elon Musk needs to show during the upcoming Tesla earnings call that he is learning from his mistakes. To maintain investors' trust, it will be important for him to explain clearly how Tesla will reach\xa0and sustain\xa0its Model 3 production targets -- all while dramatically reducing costs.Adam Levine-Weinberg\xa0has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

https://www.ibtimes.com/tesla-hell-bent-achieving-profitability-2673147,Tesla Is Hell-Bent On Achieving Profitability,Daniel Sparks,04/18/18,5:23 PM,"['After years of rapidly burning through cash,\xa0Tesla\xa0(NASDAQ:TSLA)\xa0is ready to start prioritizing profits. In the electric-car company\'s April 3 update\xa0on vehicle production and deliveries, Tesla said that achieving its target for a production rate of 5,000 Model 3 units per week by around the end of June would set the company up to ""have the long-sought ideal combination of high volume, good gross margin and strong positive operating cash flow."" Further, Tesla CEO Elon Musk was even more specific on\xa0Twitter recently, when he said the company\xa0will be profitable\xa0in both its third and fourth quarters of 2018.\xa0This article originally appeared in the Motley Fool.Now investors are getting a preview of exactly how Tesla expects to achieve higher production and profitability. According to a leaked memo to employees (via\xa0Jalopnik), strategies include moving to 24/7 operations, special approval for large expenses, and several pauses in production to upgrade tooling and systems.Here are some of the most notable takeaways from Musk\'s memo.1. Tesla\'s Recent End-Of-Quarter Push Was SustainableGiven how\xa0sharp Tesla\'s ramp-up in Model 3 production\xa0was during Q1, some investors have wondered whether achieving a weekly production rate of 2,000 Model 3s per week by the end of the period was simply an unsustainable byproduct of a herculean end-of-the-quarter push. But Musk said in his letter to employees that the company just completed its ""third full week of producing over 2000 Model 3 vehicles,"" building 2,250 last week.\xa02. Model S And X Production Isn\'t SufferingAs Tesla focused on its Model 3 production ramp-up, Model S and X production initially took a hit. After building 25,076 combined Model S and X vehicles in Q3,\xa0production for the two vehicles totaled 22,140 in Q4 as the company reallocated human resources to work on Model 3.\xa0But Model S and X production began to improve in Q1, climbing to 24,728 units. And now Model S and X production is trudging along unabated. Musk said Tesla is now producing 2,000 Model S and X vehicles per week, while producing over 2,000 Model 3s per week.Tesla\'s current weekly production rates for Model 3 and Model S and X combined extrapolates to 221,000 vehicles annually -- more than twice the total vehicles Tesla produced and delivered in 2017.\xa03. Tesla Expects Production To Jump Again This QuarterAs Tesla\xa0has done previously\xa0amid sharp increases in production, the automaker has paused its Model 3 production for three to five days in order to ""do a comprehensive set of upgrades"" to its manufacturing capabilities. These upgrades should boost production capacity to a rate of 3,000 to 4,000 Model 3 units per week by next month, Musk said. Further, ""Another set of upgrades starting in late May should be enough to unlock production capacity of 6000 Model 3 vehicles per week by the end of June,"" the CEO added.4. Tesla Is Switching To 24/7 OperationsWith Tesla\'s\xa0renewed emphasis on manual labor, the electric-car company\'s ambitious goals will require more hours from employees and 400 new hires at its factories over the next several weeks as Tesla switches to 24/7 operations at its Fremont factory. ""This means that we will be adding another shift to general assembly, body and paint,"" Musk explained. ""Please refer anyone you know who you think meets the Tesla bar for talent, drive and trust.""5. There Are No More Excuses For Reporting LossesWith Model 3 production ramping up, Musk says Tesla no longer has valid excuses to continue reporting losses.\xa0A fair criticism leveled at Tesla by outside critics is that you\'re not a real company unless you generate a profit, meaning simply that revenue exceeds costs. It didn\'t make sense to do that until reaching economies of scale, but now we are there.To ensure it achieves profitability, Musk said the company will be ""far more rigorous about expenditures"" going forward. Specifically, Tesla\'s finance department is sifting through every expense to ensure every dollar spent has ""a strong value justification."" Further, Musk said he will need to personally approve any expenses that would equal one million dollars or more over a 12-month period.2018 is proving to be a wild year for Tesla. After finishing 2017 significantly behind its initial Model 3 production targets, the automaker seems hell-bent on achieving economies of scale and profitability.Daniel Sparks\xa0owns shares of Tesla.

Initially, Tesla was aiming to wrap up 2017 producing Model 3 at an average rate of 5,000 units per week. Instead, Tesla produced just 2,425 Model 3 units during its entire fourth quarter. Further, Tesla finished the year with a weekly production run rate of only about 1,000 Model 3s.\xa0This article originally appeared in the Motley Fool.\xa0But Tesla recently proved its Model 3 production was gaining momentum when the automaker said it was producing Model 3 at a rate of\xa02,000 units per week\xa0earlier this month.\xa0And now Bloomberg\'s\xa0Model 3 Tracker\xa0suggests production has exploded to about 3,000 units per week, putting Tesla well on its way to achieving its revised target of a production rate of 5,000 Model 3 units per week in just a few months.3,000 Units Per Week And BeyondBloomberg\'s Model 3 Tracker, which uses Vehicle Identification Numbers (VINs) to forecast Tesla\'s weekly production rate, currently estimates weekly Model 3 production at 2,998 vehicles per week. This is particularly notable given that the model likely\xa0lags Tesla\'s actual production rate\xa0by as much as a few weeks. In addition, it was only two weeks ago when Tesla said it had achieved a production rate of 2,000 units per week, so this would mark a significant jump in a very short period of time.But here\'s where things really get interesting. Bloomberg\'s trend feature for its Model 3 Tracker, which provides a three-week projection based on the most recent data, is currently forecasting a weekly production rate of nearly 4,000 Model 3 vehicles. Bloomberg, however, is careful to warn that its trend estimates ""are subject to sudden corrections. If Tesla doesn\'t maintain the surge, we could see those estimated Trend rates suddenly plummet in the coming weeks.""To highlight how significant a production rate of 3,000 Model 3 units per week would be, this extrapolates to 39,000 Model 3s per quarter and 156,000 Model 3s per year. In 2017, Tesla produced just over 100,000 Model S, X, and 3\xa0combined.Of course, Tesla will need a much faster production rate to get to its eventual goal of producing about 500,000 Model 3 vehicles per year,\xa0but Bloomberg\'s Model 3 tracker gives investors a promising sign that Tesla\'s Model 3 ramp-up is gaining significant traction.Tesla Was Underrating HumansTesla\'s sudden jump in Model 3 production follows a challenging period when the company faced some production bottlenecks, namely in its battery module assembly. Tesla said in its fourth-quarter shareholder letter that it was addressing bottlenecks with more manual production from human labor -- a method Tesla CEO Elon Musk found surprisingly effective.And then we have what we call a semiautomatic line, which is a series of small automated stations manned by people. And they\'ve actually been remarkably effective. It has sort of renewed my faith in humanity that the rapid evolution of progress and the ability of people to adapt rapidly has -- is quite remarkable. Our semiautomatic -- our sort of semi-manual, semiautomatic line is exceeding all 3 of the automatic lines right now.Musk was even more blunt about how Tesla erred in trying to over-automate Model 3 production in a tweet last week\xa0when he said, ""[E]excessive automation at Tesla was a mistake. To be precise, my mistake. Humans are underrated.""Investors won\'t likely get an official update on Model 3 production until Tesla releases its quarterly update on deliveries and production, which should go live a few days after the electric-car company\'s second quarter ends. But Musk\'s forecast last week for\xa0profitability and positive cash flow in both the third and fourth quarter suggests the sharp upward trend shown in Bloomberg\'s Model 3 Tracker is likely not too far from reality.Daniel Sparks\xa0owns shares of Tesla.

https://www.ibtimes.com/big-changes-may-be-store-solar-energy-2018-2670419,Big Changes May Be In Store For Solar Energy In 2018,Travis Hoium,04/09/18,10:32 AM,"[""The solar industry can be a fast-moving place for companies and investors. But it's a long-term,\xa0multitrillion-dollar opportunity, and any company that can build a lasting business could be a huge winner for investors.\xa0This article originally appeared in the Motley Fool.As the industry evolves, companies who take the right strategy will be set up to succeed while those who take the wrong one may be doomed to failure. Here are a few trends I'm expecting to impact the fortunes of solar investors in the next few years.\xa0First Solar Is Going To Get Tariff-Free Competition In The US\xa0In the U.S., the last year in the solar industry has been dominated by rumors and then implementation of solar tariffs, which benefited very few companies. One winner was\xa0First Solar\xa0(NASDAQ:FSLR), the only company that had a large manufacturing presence here. The company took advantage of its tariff-free production by booking billions in future sales (7.7 GW booked in 2017) and locking up most of its production through 2019. But the days of being the only big tariff-free supplier may be coming to a close.\xa0We know\xa0JinkoSolar (NYSE:JKS) plans to change that by building a $50 million module assembly plant in Florida, bringing one of the biggest global suppliers to the U.S. But the bigger disruption\xa0could\xa0come from\xa0 SunPower\xa0(NASDAQ:SPWR), which is\xa0eyeing two manufacturing sites in the U.S.\xa0SunPower would assemble its P-Series solar panels, which take solar cells from commodity suppliers from around the world, in the U.S. The company could use a 2,500 megawatt (MW) exemption for cells imported into the U.S. to produce P-Series panels, so these panels could potentially be produced tariff-free. That's a big deal for First Solar because we already know that SunPower's P-Series panels have and\xa0efficiency as high as 19.6%, according to\xa0data sheets, which is significantly better than First Solar's best line panel efficiency of 17% in the fourth quarter of 2017.\xa0I think by the end of the year First Solar will have significant domestic manufacturing to compete against and SunPower is the most likely company to build capacity. That would be a big change from the last year when First Solar gained a windfall from pending solar tariffs.\xa0Energy Storage Is Going MainstreamIn 2017, we saw energy storage creep its way into the solar market, highlighted by a\xa0few utility-scale projects\xa0and SunPower booking a $60 million pipeline of commercial solar projects. But in 2018, the industry should shift into high gear.\xa0I think more and more commercial solar projects are going to include energy storage to save on both energy consumption and what's called demand charges (a fee based on a building's peak energy usage in a month). As evidence of the momentum, SunPower said during its most recent conference call with analysts that it's seeing a 30% attach rate of energy storage to commercial solar sales.\xa0On the residential side, states across the country are starting to move to time-of-use rates, or charging customers different rates depending on the time of day they use electricity. In California, time-of-use rates make electricity\xa0more expensive in evening hours\xa0when the sun is going down, which is a perfect time for stored solar energy to fill in and reduce electricity bills.\xa0As energy storage becomes easier to justify financially, the market will grow exponentially. Vivint Solar (NYSE:VSLR) and\xa0Sunrun (NASDAQ:RUN) have launched energy storage products in some states, and SunPower says its residential energy storage product is coming soon. By the end of the year, solar plus energy storage may be a standard offering for installers across the country.\xa0Tesla Is Going To Shrink Into Solar OblivionTesla's\xa0(NASDAQ:TSLA) buyout of SolarCity is looking worse by the day, highlighted by just 87 MW of solar installations in Q4 2017, down 57% from a year earlier. The solar business is slowly dying under Tesla and there's no indication we're in for a turnaround anytime soon.\xa0As a company, Tesla's focus in 2018 is, rightfully, on getting the Model 3 production line up to speed and getting that product in customers' hands. Resources have been shifted to Model 3 production and solar will take a backseat as a result.\xa0Another reason I think Tesla's solar installations will fall this year is that its sales channels aren't proven yet. The company is shutting down door-to-door sales that made SolarCity the largest residential solar installer in the U.S. and moving sales into Tesla stores, which haven't proven the ability to sell solar at scale. After losing its No. 1 market share position in 2017, the company may fall to No. 3 or 4 in the U.S. residential solar market, behind Sunrun, Vivint Solar, and maybe SunPower, a shocking fall from grace for Tesla.\xa0The Middle East Is Going To Start Taking\xa0Solar Energy SeriouslyNowhere in the world is the potential for solar energy bigger than the Middle East. The region has ample solar resources and an incentive to reduce oil consumption used for electricity generation, allowing the region to increase oil exports. It also has some of the lowest solar power purchase agreement rates in the world,\xa0recently hitting less than 2 cents per watt, cheaper than any other source of electricity for new power plants.\xa0The Middle East has had some high-profile solar goals before -- namely, Saudi Arabia's $109 billion solar plan that's gone almost nowhere three years after it was announced. But the economics are now too good to ignore and as a sign of the potential\xa0of solar, Saudi Arabia recently signed a memorandum of understanding with\xa0Softbank to build 200,000 MW of solar in Saudi Arabia, or enough to power 32.8 million U.S. homes.\xa0Solar energy in the Middle East is no longer about splashy headlines and unfulfilled promises; it's about dollars and cents. The oil and natural gas that powers most of the region is far more expensive than solar electricity, and that's what will drive installations, a trend I think will pick up speed quickly in 2018.\xa0Who Is Positioned Well For The Future Of Solar Energy?There are four companies who I think separate themselves from the competition given the trends we're seeing in solar today. First Solar has a head start in the U.S. because of the fact that it isn't subject to tariffs, but it can also benefit from growth in regions like the Middle East where its thin-film technology outperforms the competition. And with a long history of profitability (something few solar companies can claim), First Solar will likely be a winner long-term.\xa0SunPower will benefit from the integration of solar and energy storage, something it's been working on for years. If it can also add a U.S. manufacturing facility we could see this become a preferred supplier for utility-scale solar developers as well.\xa0Finally, Vivint Solar and Sunrun are benefiting from Tesla's shrinking solar business and should also build a competitive advantage as customers begin\xa0to combine rooftop solar with energy storage. They're well ahead of small, regional installers in developing energy storage and they should be able to exploit that advantage as customers demand storage with solar in the future.\xa0Travis Hoium\xa0owns shares of First Solar and SunPower.

Past notable software updates have included things as simple as updates to the sound and air conditioning systems to more exciting features like quicker acceleration times and new Autopilot driving features.Tesla is about to flex its prowess in software yet again this weekend, with CEO Elon Musk promising on\xa0Twitter on Sunday that it will start rolling out its entirely new navigation system and updated maps to its vehicles over the upcoming weekend.\xa0Highlighting how significant this update will be, the new navigation system not only provides a one-time major update to the navigation system itself and to the underlying maps, but it will also improve the upgradeability of a rare aspect of Tesla vehicles that was previously difficult to improve with software updates.The previous navigation and maps system was ""stuck with legacy 3rd party black box code and stale data,"" Musk admitted in his tweet on Sunday. There was ""No way to improve,"" he said. This explains why some owners complained to Tesla about outdated map data.\xa0But Musk warned that the new navigation system will have some flaws initially. ""Should be considered a mature beta at first, so won\'t be perfect, but will improve rapidly,"" he said on Twitter.Expectations for the update are high. Musk has previously referred to this update as a ""major navigation overhaul"" that ""will be light-years ahead"" of the current system.\xa0Major software updates from Tesla like this are worth looking into. Not only has Tesla already demonstrated a significant lead over competition when it comes to over-the-air software updates to its vehicles, but the electric-car company has made some bold promises about what customers can expect from future software updates. Any major update, therefore, helps build a case for the viability of Tesla\'s more ambitious promises, namely its promise that it will eventually release a software update that will make all of its vehicles with its\xa0late-2016 released ""hardware two"" sensor suite\xa0fully self-driving.Ultimately, every major software update provides insight into an aspect of Tesla\'s business that investors should be watching closely. Tesla\'s lead in software over competition isn\'t a competitive advantage that can erode quickly. By vertically integrating the majority of the manufacturing process for its vehicle, building its own software from the ground up, and integrating its software deeply into the DNA of its vehicles, Tesla is able to easily deploy major over-the-air software updates regularly.If Tesla\'s maps and navigation update this weekend delivers on its promise by not only giving customers a better experience but also making its navigation system easier to update in the future, Tesla will put the spotlight on one of its biggest advantages over competition: software.Daniel Sparks\xa0owns shares of Tesla.

A lightly camouflaged near-final version, which Audi is now calling the e-tron, appeared at the Geneva Motor Show earlier this month.Back in 2015, Audi said that the e-tron will have a three-motor configuration, one in front and two driving the rear wheels, with a 95 kilowatt-hour (kWh) battery providing a claimed range of ""over 500 kilometers"". (Expect a rated range of around 280 miles on the strict U.S. EPA test cycle.)More recently, Audi has said that the production version can be recharged in just under 30 minutes with a 150-kilowatt DC fast charger. (Audi uses the Combined Charging Standard, or CCS, which allows for slow AC or fast DC charging.)In a clear jab at Tesla, which conducts only very limited pre-production testing, Audi said that its fleet of pre-production e-trons has already racked up over 3 million miles in testing, in temperatures ranging from below minus-20 degrees Celsius to above 50 degrees Celsius (minus-4 to 122 degrees Fahrenheit). Audi emphasized that it\'s also conducting extensive tests of its recharging technology in conditions around the world.The takeaway: The production e-tron, which might be called the Q6 when it arrives, should be very reliable when it launches in Europe late this year.

https://www.ibtimes.com/solar-energy-storage-go-corporate-2659937,Solar And Energy Storage Go Corporate,Travis Hoium,03/05/18,11:11 AM,"[""This article originally appeared in the Motley Fool.Energy storage is finally becoming a legitimate option for utilities, commercial-building owners, and homeowners across the country. The biggest opportunity in 2018 may be in the commercial market, where the combination of solar and storage can create a cost-savings combo that gives building operators a lot of flexibility to control their energy costs.\xa0Commercial solar projects alone have always struggled to be justifiable financially, because commercial customers' bills typically include a payment for the energy they consume (consumption charge) and another portion based on their peak demand (demand charge). Traditional solar net metering may only reduce half of a customer's bill, but combining solar with energy storage can reduce the cost of both components on utility bills and makes a valuable combo for the renewable-energy industry.\xa0Most commercial energy-storage projects in the U.S. have used stand-alone systems like Stem to\xa0provide energy-storage solutions.\xa0Tesla's\xa0(NASDAQ:TSLA) Powerpack was another popular product, but it wasn't paired with SolarCity's commercial solar product in a turnkey solution.\xa0SunPower\xa0(NASDAQ:SPWR)\xa0is trying its hand at providing a one-stop-shop solution for commercial solar and energy storage, and has a good shot at leading the market. It has long been a leader in commercial solar: It has installed about 1.7 gigawatts of commercial projects around the world and claims the No. 1 market-share position in the U.S.\xa0The turnkey Helix commercial solar solution is now being combined with a product called Helix Storage to make a full solution for customers. SunPower will sell the system as a turnkey solution to installers, and develop some systems itself with large corporate customers. Then SunPower will use its own software and monitoring to control the energy-storage system to generate value.\xa0When installed, Helix Storage will reduce demand charges for customers and even store cheap solar energy for consumption when electricity prices are highest. SunPower says it can leverage the data it's gathered from monitoring\xa01.7 GW of commercial solar installations\xa0to maximize the benefits of solar plus storage in a way competitors will have a hard time matching.\xa0Bringing the solution under one roof will also help with financing. Until now, most commercial solar projects had to be financed separately from energy storage, making both tricky for developers. Bringing them together should make financing and financial justification easier.\xa0Commercial energy storage is complex in a way that residential energy storage isn't. The algorithm energy-storage companies develop needs to account for on-site consumption needs, solar energy production, time-of-use rates, and demand charges all at once.\xa0When companies roll out residential solar-plus-storage solutions, the requirements won't be nearly as complex. Most residential customers don't have demand charges, so energy storage will just have to maximize for on-site consumption needs and potential changes in time-of-use rates, effectively performing energy arbitrage where possible. So any company that can build a large market share in commercial solar plus storage will likely be able to translate that to residential solar plus storage as well. SunPower's hope is that it'll scale both starting in 2018.\xa0    Solar power Photo: Getty  Commercial solar plus storage will start as a way to save companies money on consumption and demand charges, but there could be a world of opportunities opened as installations grow.\xa0Virtual power plants could tie thousands of installations together\xa0and provide services to the grid, and we may see utilities pay for other services like frequency regulation and demand response.

https://www.ibtimes.com/tesla-wants-be-worlds-best-manufacturer-2653986,Tesla Wants To Be The World's Best Manufacturer,Daniel Sparks,02/15/18,2:03 PM,"['This article originally appeared in the Motley Fool.\xa0A few years ago, electric-car company\xa0Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) realized it was time to reprioritize much of its engineering talent away from product design and toward manufacturing. ""Tesla is going to be hell-bent on becoming the best manufacturer on earth,"" said Tesla CEO Elon Musk during the company\'s first-quarter earnings call in 2016.The shift in strategy was arguably out of necessity. With plans to launch its Model 3 in 2017, the company was about to embark on a quest to increase its annual production fivefold in just a few years\' time. But after\xa0two delays for its Model 3 production targets, things aren\'t going as planned. Tesla knew the initial phases of ramping up manufacturing of its first high-volume vehicle would be ""production hell,"" but after its worse-than-expected start, Musk admitted Tesla was in ""a deeper level of hell than we expected.""Despite its initial challenges in becoming a high-volume automaker, Musk said in the most recent earnings call that he thinks Tesla is ""swiftly exiting"" hell. Furthermore, it\'s still betting it will be the world\'s best automotive manufacturer.In its recently released fourth-quarter shareholder letter, Tesla\'s bold manufacturing aspirations were in full swing:Our goal is to become the best manufacturer in the automotive industry, and having cutting edge robotic expertise in-house is at the core of that goal. Our recent acquisitions of advanced automation companies have added to our talent base and are helping us increase Model 3 production rates more effectively.During the quarter\'s earnings call, Musk expounded on why he believes there\'s room to significantly improve automotive manufacturing.""And what I find sort of interesting is that our competitors -- well, the car industry thinks they\'re really good at manufacturing. And they\'re actually\u2028-- they are quite good at manufacturing,"" he noted, ""but they just don\'t realize just how much potential there is for improvement.""The most productive automotive manufacturing lines in the world are currently producing one vehicle about every 25 seconds, Musk said. But another way to think of this, he pointed out, is that the production line is moving at a speed of just 0.2 meters per second. ""Grandma with a walker can beat the speed of the fastest production line on earth,"" he explained. ""So really not that fast. Walking speed is 1 meter per second, so 5x faster than the fastest production line on earth.""Interestingly, part of Tesla\'s focus on not just increasing vehicle production but also on becoming the world\'s best automotive manufacturer could be what\'s behind the automaker\'s near-term production headwinds. On the flip side, however, it could also be what ultimately helps it achieve uncanny production rates further down the road.""We don\'t want to simply replicate what we have built previously while designing additional capacity,"" Tesla explained in its fourth-quarter shareholder letter. ""We want to continuously push the boundaries of mass manufacturing.""Tesla\'s long-term thinking in manufacturing was evident during the fourth-quarter earnings call, when Musk referred to ""productizing"" its factory.We\'re going to productize the factory. And really this is the lesson that is kind of obvious in history because the Model T wasn\'t a product. It was River Rouge. The Model T is a very simple car. Anybody could have made that car, but not anyone could make River Rouge.Taking on such an ambitious vision for its manufacturing likely requires outsize engineering efforts compared to an alternative scenario in which Tesla focused primarily on hitting near-term production targets.By pushing the boundaries of manufacturing, Musk believes manufacturing will be Tesla\'s competitive advantage. ""We\'ll have a great lineup of great products, great design, great engineering the product itself in the vehicles and autonomy and all that sort of stuff,"" he said. ""But the factory is going to be the product that has the long-term sustained competitive advantage, in my opinion.""Model 3 production targets undoubtedly imply extraordinary manufacturing. After just building 2,425 Model 3s in its fourth quarter, management says it can achieve a weekly production rate for Model 3 of\xa02,500 units by the end of Q1\xa0and 5,000 units by the end of Q2. After these targets are achieved, Tesla says it will then begin adding the capacity to get to a weekly rate of 10,000 Model 3s per week.\xa0In theory, it all sounds great.Of course, Tesla investors can\'t take Musk at his word yet. The electric-car maker is far from the manufacturing behemoth it wants to be, producing just over 100,000 vehicles in 2017. Sure, its vehicle production has climbed quickly from just several thousand vehicles per year in 2012. But Musk will have to prove it can at least match speeds of the fastest production lines before investors start believing Tesla can venture into uncharted territory.For now, Tesla\'s astronomical manufacturing ambitions should be viewed as nothing more than speculation. If it begins to surprise investors with better-than-expected production, that\'s when they may want to start giving some weight to this big vision for manufacturing.Maybe this is a long game that will pay off. Investors, however, simply can\'t bet on it yet.    A look at a Tesla factory. Photo: Author  Daniel Sparks\xa0owns shares of Tesla. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Tesla.

https://www.ibtimes.com/9-facts-about-artificial-intelligence-might-surprise-you-2648724,9 Facts About Artificial Intelligence That Might Surprise You,Chris Neiger,02/03/18,8:10 AM,"['This article originally appeared in the Motley Fool.Artificial intelligence (AI) is getting a lot of attention from investors these days and with good reason. It\'s a technology with the potential to transform everything from transportation to cloud computing.Many companies are betting that AI will influence not just their products and services, but nearly every aspect of their business. Read on to discover nine things you may not have to know about this burgeoning technology.Artificial intelligence is often used as a catch-all to describe computer systems that can learn. But there are more specific designations like machine learning, deep learning, and deep inference that\xa0describe the details\xa0of how those computers are learning.\xa0For example, the GPU chipmaker\xa0 NVIDIA Corp. \xa0 (NASDAQ:NVDA) \xa0defines machine learning as ""the practice of using algorithms to parse data, learn from it, and then make a determination or prediction about something in the world.""    AI Photo: Getty  A PwC\xa0report\xa0estimates that AI will contribute $15.7\xa0trillion\xa0to the global economy by 2030. AI will make products and services better, and it\'s expected to boost North America\'s GDP by 14% by that year.That\'s how much the self-driving car market is expected to be worth worldwide by 2027 -- and AI technology is crucial for making them a reality. NVIDIA created its own computer -- the\xa0Drive PX Pegasus\xa0-- specifically for driverless cars and powered by the company\'s AI and GPUs. It starts shipping this year, and 25 automakers and tech companies have already placed orders.Amazon.com\'s\xa0(NASDAQ:AMZN) Echo line, powered by its AI personal assistant, Alexa, holds 70% of the smart speaker market right now and could add $10 billion the company\'s top line by 2020. Additionally,\xa0 Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG)\xa0(NASDAQ:GOOGL)\xa0is using its own AI, called Google Assistant, to power its own competing line, and the\xa0smart speaker rivalry\xa0is only going to grow.Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos told investors last year that the company\'s machine learning systems are being used to recommend products to customers on its e-commerce platform. Beyond that, AI help\'s it determine which deals to offer and when, and influences many aspects of the business. Bezos recommended that investors\xa0watch this space.\xa0Alphabet has created its own artificial intelligence processor, called the Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), specifically designed to make its\xa0advertising, search, Gmail, Google Photos, and other services smarter. The tech giant is also using the TPUs to enhance its\xa0cloud computing servers\xa0with the goal of grabbing a bigger piece of that $411 billion market.\xa0Tesla\xa0 (NASDAQ: TSLA) \xa0CEO Elon Musk -- who\'s no stranger to advanced technology --\xa0has warned on multiple occasions\xa0that artificial intelligence could eventually be dangerous to people -- and to humanity as a whole. He recommends some regulation around the technology and specifically wants a ban on any type of autonomous weaponry. Considering the fact that some governments\xa0are already working on AI controlled weapons, his request sounds reasonable.Hawking is one of many deep thinkers who believe AI systems will eliminate many jobs, and not create enough to replace them. Specifically, he\xa0said, ""The automation of factories has already decimated jobs in traditional manufacturing, and the rise of artificial intelligence is likely to extend this job destruction deep into the middle classes, with only the most caring, creative or supervisory roles remaining."" He\'s far from alone in his views.\xa0PwC says that 38% of U.S. jobs will be\xa0vulnerable to AI\xa0over the next 15 years.Some researchers expect artificial intelligence systems to be only one-tenth as smart as a human by 2035. But things may start to get a little awkward around 2060 when AI could start performing\xa0nearly all the tasks humans do\xa0-- and doing them much better.Artificial intelligence has so much potential across so many different industries, it can be hard for an investor looking to profit from it to know where to start. As a first step, check out these\xa0AI stocks you don\'t have to babysit.\xa0Just don\'t forget to take the long view when it comes to any AI investments. Companies like NVIDIA and Amazon may be benefiting from the technology right now, but it may take a while for others to reap the benefits from their early AI investments -- so be patient.']"

Thanks to the unveiling of  Tesla’s new, bizarre looking semi-trucks, the company has managed to shine the spotlight on itself for more positive reasons.American retail giant Walmart announced its plan to test the new electric tractor trailer Friday, preordering 15 for its large truck fleet. According to  CNBC, five of those trailers will be in the United States Walmart fleet, while 10 of them will go to the Canadian fleet. The total size of the fleet is 6,000 trucks, so these trailers will make up only a tiny fraction of the total fleet.The news was met with applause from investors. After Walmart’s announcement, Tesla shares rose 1.95 percent to $318.59 per share.Tesla shares rise from session low after Wal-Mart tells CNBC that it plans to test the company&#39;s new electric semi trucks. https://t.co/j1NDRwqiVJ pic.twitter.com/xWvInNkjt2&mdash; CNBC Now (@CNBCnow) November 17, 2017""We believe we can learn how this technology performs within our supply chain, as well as how it could help us meet some of our long-term sustainability goals, such as lowering emissions,” Walmart told  CNBC.Tesla unveiled the electric semi plan at an event Thursday, which  Business Insider broke down. It is certainly more sleek and futuristic in appearance than your average semi truck trailer, but the guts inside are the real story. Instead of relying on diesel fuel, it uses Tesla’s usual electric car technology to theoretically transport goods in a more environmentally friendly and efficient manner.The company claims the trucks will get 500 miles out of a charge, and can get 400 miles worth of charge in half an hour using new, powered up chargers. It will supposedly be able to go 0 to 60 miles per hour in five seconds without a trailer and in 20 seconds with cargo.Fascinatingly, the interior of the cabin is unlike any normal semi truck. The driver has enough room to stand and, when sitting, has two touch screen interfaces surrounding the steering wheel. It almost looks like an airplane cockpit. The screens will help with navigation and other such features. Modern autopilot features aim to help the trucks navigate turns and avoid collisions, as well.Lastly, Musk said one driver can lead a convoy of trucks using autonomous driving features. Whether this is the future of trucking or the next step on the path to humanity’s eradication at the hands of robots remains to be seen.']"

Furthermore, the company says it reflects improved production efficiencies.• Motley Fool Issues Rare Triple-Buy AlertImproving marginsIn a statement\xa0about the price decrease, Tesla cited an improved Model X gross profit margin as the primary reason for the lower price. ""When we launched Model X 75D, it had a low gross margin. As we\'ve achieved efficiencies, we are able to lower the price and pass along more value to our customers,"" Tesla said.In the\xa0second quarter, the automaker made an automotive gross profit margin of 25% for its combined Model S and Model X sales when adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation and zero-emission vehicle credits. This is up from 23.6% in the year-ago quarter.\xa0""Untapped sales potential""The Model X price decrease comes at a good time for the electric-car maker. Since the third quarter of 2016, when Tesla delivered just under 25,000 vehicles,\xa0total vehicle deliveries have remained largely the same. Despite this stalled growth recently, management is looking for combined Model S and X deliveries to return to growth in the second half of the year, even as it ramps up deliveries of its recently launched lower-cost Model 3.\xa0Between its Model S and X, management has indicated that the Model X particularly represents a growth opportunity for the company. For instance, in its second-quarter\xa0update on vehicle deliveries, the company said there ""appears to be substantial untapped sales potential for Model X."" In addition, Tesla indicated in its second-quarter shareholder letter that it hasn\'t marketed the Model X as aggressively as it has its Model S until recently. ""During Q2, we added more Model X cars to our test drive and display fleet because our stores had been operating with far less than what was needed and, in some cases, none at all,"" Tesla explained.• This Stock Could Be Like Buying Amazon in 1997Further helping Tesla\'s case for expected Model S and X sales growth in the second half of the year, the company noted in its second-quarter shareholder letter that orders for the two models have been increasing recently -- ""both leading up to and following the Model 3 handover event."" There were worries that the July 28 launch of the Model 3, priced at $35,000, could cannibalize demand for Tesla\'s pricier vehicles. But this hasn\'t been the case.In Q2, Tesla delivered 10,000 Model X units, or about 1,550 lower than Model X deliveries in Q1. The sequential pullback in deliveries was driven by a severe production shortfall of 100 kilowatt-hour battery packs during the quarter, Tesla said. The company delivered just over 22,000 Model S and X units combined during Q2 and about 47,100 total units in the first half of the year.    Tesla Model X deliveries from 2015 through the present.

https://www.ibtimes.com/tesla-china-gigafactory-plan-revealed-elon-musk-earnings-call-2573887,Tesla China Gigafactory Plan Revealed By Elon Musk In Earnings Call,Rishabh Jain,08/03/17,5:16 AM,"[""Tesla CEO Elon Musk revealed plans for setting up a Gigafactory in China in the company's second-quarter earnings call Wednesday.“We're thinking hard about, where do we put Gigafactories three, four, five and six? We expect to keep the majority of our production in the U.S., but it's, obviously, going to make sense to establish a Gigafactory in China and Europe to serve the markets there, because it's not [possible] to build cars in California and truck them halfway around the world, particularly when you're trying to make things as affordable as possible – that really hurts,” Musk said during the call.Tesla's first Gigafactory was built at an estimated cost of $5 billion. While Tesla is setting up Gigafactories across the U.S., including one in Buffalo, New York, its plan\xa0of setting up one in China is a new development. The company has already announced plans of setting up a Gigafactory in Europe in November.Read: Tesla Motors (TSLA) Gigafactory: Battery Cell Production Starts, But Will It Ramp Up Fast Enough? “We really want to make our cars as affordable as possible. And so that does require some amount of local market production, particularly for the mass market vehicles in order to make it as accessible as possible,” Musk further said during the call.While there are no set plans for a Gigafactoryin China, Musk wants to build one eventually. The decision makes sense since the company’s offerings such as the Model 3 are in high demand in the country.According to Tesla’s Asia Pacific head, Ren Yuxiang, Model 3 reservations in China are higher than that of any other country except the U.S.Tesla\xa0would be able to avoid significant import duties for Chinese manufacturers which could drive the price of its cars and act as a deterrent for prospective customers, especially since Musk claims that the company wants to keep its cars “as affordable as possible.”But it might not be easy for Tesla to set up a China plant since the market requires foreign companies to have a local manufacturing partner. It means Tesla will have to share its technology with a Chinese company.However, this has been already done by companies such as Apple whose biggest manufacturers for its smartphones remain Chinese companies such as Foxconn, Pegatron, and Wistron.Initially, Tesla had stated it would be finalizing locations for Gigafactories 3, 4\xa0and 5 by the end of the year in its 2016 earnings report\xa0released in February.Read: Tesla (TSLA) Narrows Quarterly Loss, Announces Plan To Set Up 3 More Gigafactories “Installation of Model 3 manufacturing equipment is underway in Fremont and at Gigafactory 1, where in January we began production of battery cells for energy storage products, which have the same form-factor as the cells that will be used in Model 3. Later this year, we expect to finalize locations for Gigafactories 3, 4 and possibly 5 (Gigafactory 2 is the Tesla solar plant in New York),” the company had stated.Tesla stocks closed at an 8 percent high of $351 per share on Wednesday since the company beat expectations with revenue of $2.79 billion, in comparison to an expected $2.51 billion, according to Reuters.""]"
https://www.ibtimes.com/5-things-we-still-dont-know-about-teslas-model-3-2569819,5 Things We Still Don’t Know About Tesla’s Model 3,John Rosevear,07/24/17,9:53 AM,"['This article was originally published by the Motley Fool.For a car that is widely expected to take the world by storm soon -- and that is now officially in production -- there\'s much about Tesla\'s  (NASDAQ:TSLA) Model 3 that remains a mystery.Typically, when an automaker launches an all-new model, we get all the details in advance. We know what it looks like inside and out, how much power it\'ll have, the new features that will be offered. Often, we even know the colors that will be offered, and the pricing of the different trim levels, before the first example of the new model is shipped.\xa0Of course, Tesla has always followed its own path, often with success. But it\'s puzzling that at this late date, with the first Model 3 already delivered (to CEO Elon Musk), there\'s an awful lot that Tesla still hasn\'t told us about its most important model yet.How much will the average buyer really have to pay?Tesla has announced that the Model 3 will start at $35,000 before incentives. That\'s good to know, but it\'s not useful until we know what\'s included in that price, and how much the options cost. It\'s possible that the base model is nicely equipped, but it\'s also possible (maybe even likely) that Tesla had to cut features to get the car down to that price -- and you\'ll have to pay for expensive options packages to get a well-equipped car.\xa0Consider: Tesla\'s Model S currently ""starts at"" $69,500, but the average Model S sells for far more, reportedly around $100,000. The Model 3 won\'t be nearly that expensive, but I won\'t be surprised if the average selling price turns out to be close to $50,000.How much power does it have?Tesla loves to talk about the power and fierce acceleration of its upscale Model S and Model X. As it should: The top-of-the-line Model S P100D is one of the world\'s quickest-accelerating road cars, at least to 60 miles per hour. That performance has become a big part of Tesla\'s appeal -- and a big part of the argument that electric cars can be better than their internal-combustion rivals.So how about the Model 3? Tesla promises that it will accelerate to 60 miles per hour in ""under six seconds,"" not bad but not exactly the stuff of enthusiasts\' dreams. Musk has hinted that performance upgrades will be offered at some point, but -- again -- we still don\'t know enough to understand how the base Model 3 will stack up.\xa0What are the options?\xa0Again, we can\'t tell how much the Model 3 will really cost or even try to guess how it\'ll stack up against rivals until we know what\'s available.\xa0What\'s going on with that dashboard?Photos of pre-production Model 3s show a bare-bones dashboard with no instruments visible ahead of the driver, just a touchscreen in the center stack that looks almost like an iPad bolted to the dash.Is there a heads-up display to communicate information such as speed and range to the driver? Is there some special new technology at work? Or is that tablet-like touch screen the only source of vehicle information? We don\'t know.\xa0Why hasn\'t Tesla said more?This is really the question. What\'s behind Tesla\'s seeming lack of interest in talking up its new model? Is it gearing up for a big surprise -- some new high-tech feature that will come standard on the Model 3? Is it, as Musk has suggested, talking down the Model 3 because it\'s worried that the waiting list will become too long?Or is Tesla aware that the Model 3, the first-ever Tesla built to an affordable price point, might seem underwhelming when compared directly to rivals like BMW\'s  (NASDAQOTH:BAMXF) huge-selling 3 Series?That ""handover party"" on July 28 looks likely to be the Model 3\'s coming-out party. Hopefully, for the hundreds of thousands of Model 3 reservation holders, all of our questions (and more) will be answered then. Stay tuned.John Rosevear has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Kline,07/22/17,12:10 PM,"['This article was originally published on the Motley Fool.Science fiction has regularly dealt with the idea that artificial intelligence (AI) could lead to humanity\'s end (or at least its near end). In the Terminator series, a sentient computer system, Skynet, realizes that the best way to keep the world safe (and protect its own existence) is to wipe out mankind. In Battlestar Galactica, robots created as servants slowly outgrow their programming and come to the realization that they, not their human creators, should exist.It\'s easy to see why the idea makes for good books and movies. If, for example, artificial intelligence (AI) can beat a human at chess or on\xa0Jeopardy!, then it\'s easy to make the next leap to robots someday being smarter than humans -- and for that to go terribly wrong. That\'s a leap that\'s getting easier to make these days since robots and various other AI-powered devices have made their way into reality.• Motley Fool Issues Rare Triple-Buy AlertIn some cases, they are taking our jobs, while in others, AI handles our cybersecurity or tells us where we might like to eat dinner. Our homes have AI devices that can control our lights, alarm systems, and pretty much anything else.We may not be living in a post-apocalyptic hellhole where mankind tries to avoid being wiped out by well-armed robots and cyborgs, but our world looks like the opening scene in that type of movie. What once seemed far-fetched has become plausible, and Tesla  (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk believes we need to plan for it.What did Musk say?Without pulling any punches, Musk recently told the National Governors Association Summer Meeting that he has seen the most cutting-edge AI technology and believes that people should be ""really concerned about it."" Coming from most people -- nearly anyone else -- these comments would seem a tad paranoid. Coming from the person behind Tesla, SpaceX, and Hyperloop, they sound credible even though Musk is talking like the guy in a movie whose warning people should heed, but don\'t.""... until people see robots going on the street killing people, they don\'t know how to react because it seems so ethereal,"" he said. ""We should all be really concerned about AI.""• This Stock Could Be Like Buying Amazon in 1997The technology pioneer believes that AI is the rare case where government should be proactive instead of reactive in regulation. It won\'t work to wait until people are complaining.""AI is a fundamental risk to human civilization in a way that car accidents, airplane crashes, faulty drugs, or bad food were not,"" he said. ""They were harmful to a set of individuals, but not harmful to society as a whole.""Musk believes that the race to build the next-best-thing in AI will lead to companies cutting corners. Without regulation, he expects that to lead to a problem that could cause potential challenges to ongoing human existence. He, of course, did not mention\xa0Terminator,\xa0Battlestar Galactica, or any other sci-fi doomsday scenario, but he clearly believes one could happen.\xa0Is Musk right?We already have machines that can advance beyond their programming without human help. It\'s not an unfathomable leap to think an evolving AI could come to the conclusion that protecting humanity involves enslaving or even exterminating humans.Musk is right that limits should be placed. In the same way government has forced the self-driving-car movement to move slower than many companies would want, some sensible regulation for AI -- specifically around testing and what we allow artificial intelligence to control -- could forestall, if not eliminate, the possibility of disaster.• 7 of 8 People Are Clueless About This Trillion-Dollar MarketIf we create near-sentient AI devices/robots that both learn and think for themselves, we open up the possibility for catastrophic problems.

Since management expects the $35,000 vehicle to increase Tesla's annual production from a rate of 100,000 units today to 500,000 units next year and 1 million units by 2020, Tesla is not only going to need much higher production capacity, but also sufficient sales, service, and charging networks to support this higher volume.In anticipation of its Model 3 launch, Tesla has already begun\xa0doubling down on its Supercharger network, recently announcing a massive expansion to the fast-charging stations, which already enable driving anywhere in the U.S. (except Arctic Alaska) and most of Europe, China, and Japan. And now Tesla's next focus is the future of Tesla service.The future of Tesla serviceEarlier this week, Tesla announced significant expansion plans for its service network. Within the next 12 months, Tesla will add 100 new service centers to its 150-plus centers today, 350 new vans for mobile service, and 1,400 new technicians, increasing its overall service capacity by a factor of three worldwide. In addition, Tesla announced that it will soon roll out a feature that allows customers to schedule service from their vehicles.Tesla's new service centers will have significantly more service capacity than previous centers. To achieve this, the centers will include up to 40 repair lanes. Tesla believes this streamlined approach will make its service centers four times faster than conventional auto-repair centers, using up to three times less space.\xa0For years, service has been central to Tesla's expansion strategy. The company has put high-quality service at the forefront of its customer experience -- an effort that has likely helped word-of-mouth marketing. There's evidence of Tesla's emphasis on quality: The company has consistently been awarded\xa0top marks in customer satisfaction for its service.Tesla's focus on service has persisted this year, as the company's wait times and repair times at its service centers have reached record lows in the past six months.\xa0In addition, Tesla noted this week that it can now diagnose and address 90% of vehicle issues remotely without sending a technician to the vehicle.Tesla's service is also made easier by the company's regular over-the-air updates, which proactively address bugs and make vehicle improvements.Tesla service is more important than everWith Tesla planning to increase its annualized production fivefold by next year as it attempts to make a dent in its approximately 400,000 Model 3 reservations, the electric-car maker will obviously need to be ready to welcome its new customers with a great service experience.To this end, Tesla says it's basing its service expansion on its map of Model 3 reservation holders. This will enable Tesla to launch more service centers and deploy more mobile service vans in the areas with its most concentrated Model 3 deliveries.Tesla expects to deliver about 30 Model 3 units at its delivery event on July 28 and increase its monthly deliveries to about 20,000 units in December.\xa0At some point next year, Tesla wants its Model 3 production to reach 10,000 units a week.Daniel Sparks\xa0owns shares of Tesla.

But with this new system, there\'s a catch: When -- and whether -- Audi\'s Level 3 system becomes available in markets around the world will depend on government regulations.• Motley Fool Issues Rare Triple-Buy AlertWhat\'s a Level 3 self-driving system?People in the auto industry use a system of ""levels"" (from Level 0 to Level 5) as a shorthand to describe the capabilities of a driver-assist system. A Level 3 system is one that allows hands-off driving under some circumstances, but requires the driver to be alert and ready to take back control of the car. (That requirement has raised concerns within the industry -- more on that in a bit.)An important point to remember is that the ""level"" of a given system isn\'t determined by third-party testing. It\'s a label applied by the manufacturer, which is presumably in the best position to know what its system can (and can\'t) do.In at least one way, Audi\'s system is a big advanceAudi said that the all-new A8 -- its top-of-the-line large luxury sedan -- was developed with autonomous driving in mind. But its new system will work only in specific, limited circumstances, at least at first.The new A8 is the first production automobile to have been developed specially for highly automated driving. The Audi AI ""traffic jam pilot"" takes charge of driving in slow-moving traffic at up to 60 kilometers per hour (37.3 mph), on freeways and highways where a physical barrier separates the two carriageways.Although the claimed capabilities of Audi\'s system are fairly modest, the system itself does break new ground for a production vehicle. It appears that Audi will be the first automaker to offer a vehicle equipped with a laser scanning unit, or lidar.Lidar uses invisible laser beams to create an extremely precise ""map"" of the vehicle\'s surroundings that is continuously updated. Typically, a self-driving system compares the lidar image to a highly detailed 3D map to understand exactly where the vehicle is located.Lidar units are key to most of the self-driving systems under development. The high cost of existing lidar units has been one factor holding back self-driving vehicles, but costs are falling rapidly.• This Stock Could Be Like Buying Amazon in 1997Is it really a Level 3 system?It\'s a Level 3 system because Audi said that it\'s a Level 3 system. (That\'s really how it works.)But that said, the stated capabilities of Audi\'s system aren\'t all that different from systems already being offered by Mercedes-Benz and Tesla  (NASDAQ:TSLA) , and soon to be offered by General Motors (NYSE:GM) on its Cadillac CT6 sedan.If anything, Audi\'s system is more modest than Tesla\'s Autopilot and Cadillac\'s Super Cruise. Like Mercedes\' Traffic Jam Assist, Audi\'s system is limited to stop-and-go highway driving at low speeds, while Tesla and (soon) Cadillac allow hands-off driving at full highway speeds.Note that Tesla and Cadillac both describe their systems as Level 2.Why Level 3 systems raise concernsConsider: A Level 3 system like Audi\'s does the driving for you under limited circumstances, but it needs you to take over quickly when the car\'s situation exceeds the system\'s capabilities.If the human driver is distracted, it might take several seconds to refocus, understand the car\'s situation, and take control. The concern is about that time lag: What\'s happening to the vehicle while the human is getting his or her bearings?That concern has led some automakers, including Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) to declare that they would skip Level 3, and work toward a full Level 4 system that can drive the car under most circumstances instead.When will buyers be able to get Audi\'s new system?The new A8 will launch in Europe this fall, and will arrive in the U.S. sometime next spring. But when the new Level 3 system will be available is another question, and the answers will vary by country. Right now, it isn\'t even legal to offer a Level 3 system in Audi\'s home country of Germany, though Audi\'s CEO expects that to change next year.• 7 of 8 People Are Clueless About This Trillion-Dollar MarketI won\'t be surprised if Audi works with U.S. regulators to make way for the system sometime next year. At that point, we\'ll see how well it stacks up against rivals.John Rosevear owns shares of Ford and General Motors. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Ford and Tesla.

And it\'s likely that the Model 3\'s sales will outpace the Bolt\'s before too long.• Motley Fool Issues Rare Triple-Buy AlertBut so far, at least, the Model 3 hype hasn\'t stopped GM from attracting more and more buyers to its own highly creditable electric entry.Bolt sales have been rising since early this yearHere\'s a look at how the Bolt\'s U.S. sales have stacked up month by month since its launch in December.    Chevy Bolt sales from December 2016 through June 2017. Photo: The Motley Fool  GM filled initial orders from its dealers in California and Oregon -- the first dealers certified to sell the electric Chevy -- in December and January. Sales dipped a bit in February, after that initial rush of orders, but they\'ve risen every month since as GM has ramped up production and gradually rolled out the Bolt to more dealers around the country.The total sales numbers are still fairly small, of course (consider that GM sold over 50,000 Chevy Silverado pickups in the U.S. last month), but it\'s likely that they\'ll keep growing for at least another few months. And even if they never get to Silverado levels, at some point, we\'ll be able to judge whether the Bolt is a success for GM.\xa0Why\xa0U.S. sales of the Bolt should climb further over the next few monthsI expect Bolt sales to ramp up further over the next few months, because a lot of U.S. Chevy dealers just became eligible to order them. GM had only opened Bolt sales to dealers in a handful of states before June. But that changed on June 1, when GM opened its ordering system to all U.S. Chevrolet dealers that have completed GM\'s electric-vehicle training program.\xa0• This Stock Could Be Like Buying Amazon in 1997Bolts ordered in June will likely arrive at dealers sometime in August, a GM official said last month. Not coincidentally, GM is expected to launch a national marketing campaign for the Bolt later in the summer, just as those Bolts are arriving at dealerships.Translation: If all goes according to plan, we should see a big bump in Bolt sales in September or thereabouts.\xa0At what point do we declare the Bolt to be a success?It\'s hard to say exactly how many Bolts GM will have to sell to declare it a ""success."" (In a way, it\'s already a success: It\'s a good product that delivers on GM\'s promises.) But we have an idea of how many GM expected to produce when the Bolt was developed.Back in mid-2015, as GM\'s engineers were working on turning the Bolt show car into a production vehicle, Reuters reported that GM\'s annual production goal was between 25,000 and 30,000. That includes production of both the Bolt and its Opel twin, the Ampera-e, for markets around the world.\xa030,000 vehicles a year is just 2,500 a month (on average), though I strongly suspect that GM could boost that number considerably if demand warranted. With over 1,600 sold in the U.S. last month, and a sales boost expected by the end of the summer, GM may find itself needing to make some production decisions before long.\xa0But to the question: GM may well consider the Bolt to be a success at around 2,500 global sales a month, at least for now.\xa0(Side note: GM hasn\'t yet released global sales totals for the Bolt, but a GM spokesperson confirmed to me that it will begin doing so before long.)\xa0But what about the Model 3?Tesla never quite manages to deliver on its lofty sales and production goals. But even so, monthly production (and sales) of the Model 3 should surpass the Bolt\'s well before the end of 2017.Will that mean the Bolt is a failure? Not at all: GM created the Bolt as a statement at a time when it wasn\'t clear that there would be a retail market for electric cars not made by Tesla. GM hedged its bet by making the Bolt an urban runabout, a vehicle especially well-suited for ride-hailing and car-sharing services. The Bolt was also designed to be the platform for GM\'s autonomous-vehicle and connected-car development efforts.• 7 of 8 People Are Clueless About This Trillion-Dollar MarketThose decisions ensured that there would be a market for the Bolt. But at the same time, they probably limited the little crossover\'s appeal. The Bolt isn\'t sleek and sexy like a Tesla, something that led many analysts to conclude that GM missed the mark -- until they looked deeper at GM\'s intentions for the Bolt.\xa0The Model 3, on the other hand, is a sleekly styled compact luxury sports sedan, an electric alternative to BMW\'s huge-selling 3-Series and its rivals. Its natural market is a lot bigger: If it doesn\'t handily outsell the Bolt, Tesla has a problem.The upshot: Keep in mind that the Bolt is a beginningGM CEO Mary Barra has hinted that GM has more electric vehicles under development. We may look back in a few years and conclude that the Bolt was GM\'s proof of concept, a low-risk way to begin building the knowledge, resources, and supplier base that the company will need to transition more of its portfolio to electric drivetrains.\xa0I think the Bolt will be a success if GM sells as many as it expected -- and if the Bolt leads to more (and better-selling) electric vehicles from the General.

The company reported second-quarter delivery figures over the weekend, which put deliveries in the first half near the\xa0low end of guidance.• Motley \xa0Fool \xa0Issues Rare Triple-Buy AlertAdding insult to injury, Goldman Sachs analyst David Tamberrino reiterated\xa0his sell rating on Tesla this week while lowering his price target from $190 to $180 -- roughly\xa0half\xa0where shares finished last week. Unit volumes ""appear to be plateauing"" at just under an annual run rate of 100,000, according to\xa0Tamberrino.Let\'s look at the evidence.Growth is already deceleratingFor starters, Tesla has now issued some cautiously vague guidance for the second half of 2017, merely saying that deliveries in the second half ""will likely exceed deliveries"" in the first half. That implies full-year deliveries of around 94,000, notably\xa0including\xa0Model 3, which will begin production tomorrow.    Tesla deliveries from 2013-2017.

Photo: The Motley Fool  I expect that Tesla will provide more granular detail for its outlook when it reports second-quarter earnings, but the company may still play it conservatively since there\'s considerable uncertainty regarding the Model 3 ramp.A tale of two missing metricsGenerally speaking, it also doesn\'t inspire a lot of investor confidence when a company abruptly stops disclosing any metric it had previously shared. In Tesla\'s case, there are two: order rate growth and in-transit vehicles. Tesla opted not to disclose order rate growth in the first quarter, after doing so for many quarters.    Tesla\'s order rate. Photo: The Motley Fool  • This Stock Could Be Like Buying Amazon in 1997This lack of disclosure did not go unnoticed. When directly asked\xa0about the figure, CEO Elon Musk dodged:Well, the -- I think we feel pretty good about achieving the sort of the 100k, roughly 100k, total for the year for S and X, combined. That\'s where we kind of want to be. The manufacturing system at the supply chain is all sort of set up for that level.When pressed further, Musk sidestepped again:I don\'t think it\'s meaningful. We\'re going to produce 100,000 units approximately, so all that matters is there\'s demand. Is there going to be demand for 100,000 units? I believe there will be. And there is.It\'s worth noting that the recent implied guidance seems to walk back Musk\'s prediction of selling 100,000 Model S and Model X vehicles this year.\xa0Clearly, order rate growth was meaningful enough to previously disclose, so the omission just raises suspicion. The same is true for Tesla not disclosing how many vehicles were in transit at the end of the second quarter.    How many Tesla vehicles were in transit at the end of the second quarter. Photo: The Motley Fool  Some cannibalization was always inevitableThere appears to be at least some evidence that Model S and Model X demand could be peaking. To be fair, Tesla believes that\xa0there ""appears to be substantial untapped sales potential for Model X."" The company is still in the process of building out its retail inventory and test-drive fleet, which it concedes has been ""far short of what was needed"" to date. The SUV has also been plagued with quality issues, which Tesla says it has been ""fairly criticized"" for. Initial quality problems are now rare, according to the company.Regardless, even if Model S and Model X demand is peaking, that should be partially expected with the imminent launch of Model 3. It\'s safe to say that many prospective customers would rather buy a more affordable vehicle, even if it has fewer bells and whistles than the flagship vehicles. In other words, it shouldn\'t be surprising that there is some cannibalization when you launch a product at half the price.Musk has acknowledged that Model S orders are being impacted by Model 3, but attributes that to confusion that Model 3 could be incorrectly perceived as the ""next generation Tesla."" The cannibalization effect is perhaps more feasible.If demand is indeed peaking, that only applies to Model S and Model X. It\'s too early to know how Model 3 will fare in terms of supply (production) and demand; Tesla has declined to update its Model 3 reservation tally, but it\'s\xa0probably still around 400,000\xa0based on customer deposit trends.• 7 of 8 People Are Clueless About This Trillion-Dollar MarketFurthermore, Tesla\'s valuation is predicated on the company becoming a mainstream manufacturer with the Model 3 and\xa0Model Y crossover SUV. So while Model S and Model X sales are undoubtedly critical (and more profitable on a gross margin basis), Model 3 arguably remains more important to the company\'s future. Tesla\'s execution on ramping production and maintaining quality for the $35,000 sedan in the next six to 12 months is where investors should be focusing.Evan Niu, CFA\xa0owns shares of Tesla.

The way IQS works is that J.D. Power collects customer registration data from individual states and uses that information to send surveys to tens of thousands of people who have purchased or leased a vehicle for the relevant model year. However, the snag is that California, Tesla\'s homeland, requires that state officials receive permission from automakers before releasing this specific data. As the sole automaker not allowing access, Tesla is not included in J.D. Power\'s study because of lack of sufficient data.One possible reason behind Tesla\'s refusal to play nice with J.D. Power\'s IQS is that the automaker has a tendency to push out technology early, before every last bug has been fixed. Furthermore, Tesla\'s vehicles are known for their large center console screens, and even small issues with a vehicle\'s infotainment systems have sent companies, such as\xa0 Ford Motor Company ,\xa0spiraling down the rankings\xa0in previous years. Perhaps, too, because of recent criticism due to smaller quality issues with new components -- such as the Model X\'s falcon-wing doors, or the Autopilot system, which is under scrutiny following a couple of crashes -- Tesla would prefer to avoid such studies until it has an even larger amount of data for J.D.

Tesla will be reporting its second-quarter vehicle deliveries anytime between the first and third of July.• Motley Fool Issues Rare Triple-Buy AlertWith Tesla stock trading about 41% higher in the past three months, will the company live up to the Street's high expectations?What to expectFor the first half of 2017, Tesla said it expected a big year-over-year jump in vehicle deliveries. Management guided for a 61% to 71%\xa0increase in Model S and Model X deliveries during the first half of the year compared with the first half of 2016. To accomplish this goal, Tesla would need to deliver 47,000 to 50,000 vehicles in Q1 and Q2 combined.After its first quarter, it was clear that Tesla was on track to meet this guidance. The company delivered just over 25,000 vehicles during Q1.\xa0The deliveries represented 69% year-over-year growth compared with deliveries in the first quarter of 2016, leaving 22,000 to 25,000 units for Tesla to deliver in its second quarter for Tesla to hit its guidance range. With its first-quarter deliveries behind it, Tesla said its outlook for the first half of the year remained unchanged.\xa0One interesting aspect of Tesla's second-quarter vehicle sales will be the electric-car maker's model-specific deliveries. While Model S sales growth has essentially halted, failing to grow beyond levels achieved in the fourth quarter of 2015, it's unclear whether Model X sales can continue to rise every quarter.Tesla's sharp growth in vehicle deliveries in Q1 could be mostly attributed to higher Model X deliveries. During the quarter, Tesla delivered about 13,450 Model S units and 11,550 Model X units. While Model S sales were up about 8% year over year, Model X sales nearly quadrupled over the year-ago quarter.But now that Model X sales are beginning to rival Model S sales, the SUV's sales growth is slowing.

During its second quarter, Tesla has expressed some concern about consumer perception that its Model 3 is a more affordable and better version of its older vehicles. While it is more affordable, Tesla's more expensive Model S and Model X are still the electric-car company's best vehicles.To better communicate the differences of its Model 3 and its Model S, Tesla released a comparison sheet,\xa0which highlighted differences in the vehicles' sizes, acceleration, range, cargo space, and more.Tesla's obvious concern about consumer perception that the Model 3 is better than the Model S suggests that management might be seeing lower-than-expected demand for the Model S ahead of Tesla's Model 3 launch in July. Of course, Tesla's decision to maintain its guidance for 47,000 to 50,000 vehicles in the first half of the year after delivering 25,000 units in Q1 already bakes in a possible sequential decrease in vehicle deliveries.

That\'s going to take a lot of cash.• Motley \xa0Fool \xa0Issues Rare Triple-Buy AlertIn an SEC filing\xa0from last Friday, Tesla disclosed that it had increased its borrowing capacity by approximately $800 million. The increase is to Tesla\'s long-standing asset-based line (ABL) that it uses to in part provide bridge financing for in-transit vehicles. The ABL line is being extended by $625 million to $1.825 billion, with flexibility for an additional $175 million that would bring the total ABL commitment up to $2 billion.""an S-curve of capital spend""Following a successful secondary offering in March that comprised stock and convertible notes at\xa0minimal dilutive cost\xa0to existing shareholders, Tesla finished\xa0out the first quarter with $4 billion in cash on hand to help support the Model 3 launch.• This Stock Could Be Like Buying Amazon in 1997In terms of cash flow, Tesla is facing a large sequential uptick in outgoing payments related to the launch. Responding to an analyst question on the last earnings call regarding capital spending and capital efficiency, CFO Deepak Ahuja said (emphasis added):We\'re always trying to be capital efficient. That is the underlying theme of every step we take. And clearly, some of that is part of it. But I think overall would be -- again, because of this massive scale of payments,\xa0 whether it\'s last week of June or first week of July, how many hundreds of millions we end up paying, it\'s hard to be precise. It\'s almost like an S-curve of capital spend \xa0that we\'re going through here. So I don\'t think it\'s any indication of anything else except timing at the highest level -- beyond the capital efficiency that we are continually working on.It\'s also worth recalling what Tesla primarily uses its ABL for. Since Tesla ships vehicles directly to customers, unlike its automotive peers, it has an awful lot of cash tied up in those in-transit vehicles. The ABL helps Tesla access that cash sooner than would be otherwise possible. Here\'s CEO Elon Musk describing the ABL in the Q1 2016 conference call:Unlike other automotive companies, Tesla doesn\'t ship to dealers. We ship to customers. So we build the cars to order. The car is complete and it\'s going to a known customer. So really the only risk associated with that is if like the ship sinks or something, or the truck that\'s carrying the cars crashes. But the ABL is, the Asset Backed Line is basically finished goods in transit to known customers. It\'s not like general corporate debt. It\'s I think more appropriately thought of as a slight increase in cost of goods sold.These are the two factors that provide context for the $800 million increase. The company is planning a substantial increase in deliveries with Model 3, which will increase the number of in-transit vehicles. At the same time, it will need to make massive payments to suppliers as it ramps up Model 3 production.

In terms of the music selection, I think there are going to be some exciting announcements in terms of the music selection. I think it\'s very hard to find good playlists or good matching algorithms.

With everything that Tesla currently has on its plate -- preparing for the imminent Model 3 launch, designing the Model Y and Tesla Semi, continuing to integrate SolarCity and launch the solar roof, investing in infrastructure to support a larger fleet, just to name a few -- does it really make sense for Tesla allocate time and energy into music streaming?• This Stock Could Be Like Buying Amazon in 1997Tesla Music?Musk wasn\'t joking. Recode reports that Tesla is in licensing negotiations with the major record labels, discussing the possibility of creating a proprietary music service for its vehicles. Tesla currently integrates Slacker Radio into its vehicles in the U.S., and Spotify into its vehicles outside the U.S.Tesla didn\'t deny the report, either. ""We believe it\'s important to have an exceptional in-car experience so our customers can listen to the music they want from whatever source they choose,"" a Tesla spokesperson told Recode. ""Our goal is to simply achieve maximum happiness for our customers.""The whole thing sounds like a potentially needless distraction. It\'s unlikely that a Tesla music-streaming service would serve as a differentiating factor, and it\'s just as unlikely that Tesla will beat incumbents at developing better matching algorithms.There\'s also a matter of scale. Through the first quarter, Tesla had sold roughly 210,000 Model S and Model X vehicles combined to date, so the installed base is smaller than that figure because some of those vehicles have been retired, wrecked, or are otherwise no longer in service. The two largest paid music-streaming services, Spotify and Apple Music, now command almost 80 million subscribers combined. Those are services that already span across devices, which users have already customized to their tastes.It would be much easier for Tesla to negotiate and expand Spotify\'s availability, or integrate Apple Music directly. Apple probably isn\'t willing to grant access to Apple Music unless Tesla is willing to support Apple CarPlay, which would essentially surrender the interface to the Mac maker, and Tesla doesn\'t want that.

Tesla sets up its stores in high-foot-traffic areas, such as indoor and outdoor malls, and uses them both to sell vehicles and to educate consumers about electric vehicles.

""Our plan is to keep expanding the retail-store footprint to be able to cover anyone who could buy our product.""The Gigafactory is on scheduleMusk also said the company\'s Gigafactory is ""going quite well."" The timing of Tesla\'s ramp-up of battery production at the factory is crucial for Tesla, as expected higher production for its July-slated, mass-market-priced Model 3 will require unprecedented battery production.Beyond noting that the factory\'s progress is on track, Musk said its output will make all other battery production pale in comparison. ""We believe it will be -- within a few years -- have a [production] capacity equal to all other lithium-ion battery factories combined -- in one building.""Importantly, Musk said the economies of scale from the Gigafactory will enable Tesla to have the lowest cost per kilowatt-hour of battery capacity while also having the most advanced battery technology.

Musk shares some insight about the Model 3, the upcoming Tesla semi-truck, the Model Y, and a mystery product.1. Model 3The Model 3, of course, is well-deserving of its immense attention from investors. With Tesla planning on the vehicle\'s demand and production to help take the company from producing around 100,000 vehicles per year today to 500,000 next year, the $35,000 vehicle is critical to Tesla\'s success.Here\'s what Musk said about the Model 3 during the annual meeting:""The initial configurator will be very limited,"" Musk noted.""This is critical to achieving a rapid production ramp,"" he added, admitting that Tesla made the mistake of launching its Model X SUV with ""way too much complexity"" right from the beginning. ""It was very foolish,"" Musk said.Specifically, the configurator will have only two options: wheel size and paint color.Since Tesla has already garnered around 400,000 deposit-backed reservations for Model 3 (which are increasing every week), this suggests Tesla expects to deliver around 400,000 Model 3 vehicles or more before the end of 2018 -- a huge jump from Tesla\'s 2016 deliveries of under 80,000 units.2. Tesla semiTesla\'s semi is still on schedule for a September unveiling, Musk said.• This Stock Could Be Like Buying Amazon in 1997Further, Musk said the company is working with large contractors and has already shown prototypes to them. ""And they all love it,"" Musk noted. ""And they just want to know how many they can buy, and how soon.""Musk continued:We\'re getting [the large truck contractors] closely involved in the design process. So the biggest customers of the heavy-duty Tesla semi are helping ensure that it is specified to their needs. So it\'s not a mystery. They already know that it\'s going to meet their needs because they told us what those needs are. So, it\'s really going to be a question of scaling volume to make as many as we can.3. Model YMusk said he is ""really excited"" about the Model Y, which is Tesla\'s next consumer vehicle in its product road map after the Model 3. Here\'s what Musk said about Tesla\'s plans for the vehicle.I think we made a mistake in trying to derive the Model X from the Model S platform. It would have just been best to design an SUV the way a SUV should be designed. Design a sedan the way a sedan should be designed. Otherwise, you\'re just trying to shoehorn something in that just doesn\'t make sense.Citing another reason for building the Model Y on its own platform, Musk said there are lots of other major manufacturing improvements that can be done that would enable Tesla to build vehicles with ""substantially less"" capital expenditures""Greater demand for the Model Y would be quite a feat, considering the impressive level of demand for the Model 3, despite very\xa0limited marketing.4. A mystery productBeyond the Model 3, Model Y, and Tesla\'s semi, there\'s apparently an unannounced product that will soon be unveiled.""I would just really recommend showing up for the semi-truck unveiling,"" Musk said. ""Maybe there\'s a little more than we\'re saying here.""• 7 of 8 People Are Clueless About This Trillion-Dollar MarketPerhaps Tesla will unveil an additional product alongside the Tesla semi.

But why are investors so confident in Tesla's ability to grow?There's a handful of reasons investors are betting Tesla can rapidly grow its vehicle sales in the years ahead, including the approximately 400,000 deposit-backed reservations the company has already garnered for its upcoming Model 3 and Tesla's leadership position in the fast-growing long-range EV segment. But one reason investors may be bullish on Tesla's future prospects is because of the company's staggering sales growth in the past.• Motley Fool Issues Rare Triple-Buy AlertHere's a look at Tesla's incredible growth in three charts.Annual deliveries are soaringThanks to the success of Tesla's Model S sedan and a follow-up launch of its well-received Model X SUV, Tesla's vehicle deliveries have risen sharply since 2012. Between the first half of 2012 and today, Tesla has gone from selling hundreds of vehicles a quarter to tens of thousands every quarter.    Tesla annual vehicle deliveries, per quarterly SEC filings. Photo: The Motley Fool.  In 2016, Tesla delivered just over 76,000 vehicles, up 51% compared to its deliveries in 2015.Model X proves Tesla isn't a one-hit wonderAhead of Tesla's launch of its Model X SUV in late 2015, there was no certainty the new vehicle would resonate with customers as well as the Model S did. After all, the Model S' success was alarming -- the vehicle's North American sales quickly rose to surpass those of all comparably priced luxury sedans, and Model S has continued to outsell similarly priced competition, whether it be electric, hybrid, or gas, ever since. But the Model X has similarly seen its sales soar, and sales don't look like they're done increasing yet.    Tesla Model X deliveries, according to quarterly SEC filings. Photo: The Motley Fool  Consider Tesla's Model X sales in its most recent quarter, which were up nearly 400% year over year and 21% sequentially.• This Stock Could Be Like Buying Amazon in 1997Size is helping Tesla's growth accelerateOn the surface, it would seem reasonable to argue that Tesla's past growth is irrelevant to the big growth investors are expecting in the future. This past growth has been on a much smaller base, critics might point out. But Tesla's growth is accelerating as the company gets bigger.    Tesla trailing-12-month vehicle sales growth, per quarterly SEC filings. Photo: The Motley Fool  For much of 2014 and 2015, Tesla's annual vehicle sales growth was under 50%. But Tesla is growing sales at higher rates recently.Further, Tesla has kicked off 2017 with more extraordinary growth. Vehicle deliveries in the first quarter of 2017 were up 69% compared to the year-ago quarter, and for the first six months of 2017, Tesla expects deliveries to be up 61% to 71%, compared with the same period in 2016.Tesla management is as confident as ever in Tesla's ability to accelerate its growth even more. For its July slated Model 3, Tesla is aiming to achieve a production rate of 5,000 vehicles per week by the end of the year, and 10,000 per week at some point next year.• 7 of 8 People Are Clueless About This Trillion-Dollar MarketInvestors shouldn't automatically conclude that Tesla's uncanny growth will persist just because the company has consistently delivered strong growth in the past. What Tesla expects to do next is mind-boggling. Management is forecasting annual production will increase from a rate of about 100,000 units today to 500,000 next year.

Shares are up about 69% since Dec. 15.The stock\'s rise comes ahead of the company\'s planned start for Model 3 production.

With July only about a month away, and no word of any production delays, Tesla\'s aggressive timeline for bringing its Model 3 to market appears to be on schedule.• Motley Fool Issues Rare Triple-Buy AlertTesla\'s most recent updates on the vehicle\'s timeline support this idea. The Model 3 is ""on track for initial production in July,"" Tesla said in its May 3 quarterly update.\xa0 Going further, Tesla said it now expects to achieve a production rate for the Model 3 of 5,000 vehicles per week at some point in 2017.And Tesla CEO Elon Musk\'s more recent comments about the Model 3 continue to suggest that the company is on schedule with its production ramp-up.

A growth ramp-up like this would not only help Tesla further fortify its lead in the electric-vehicle market, but it would also position the company solidly to compete with the world\'s largest automakers, which produce vehicles in the millions every year.In light of Tesla stock\'s recent rise, investors are on board with Tesla management\'s expectations for volume production.

They\'ve put an awful lot of effort into very risky things. I\'m going to bet on Tesla,"" he told the publication.When asked how Tesla is different from the company he founded, he added, ""They started with a car -- the Tesla Model S -- that made little sense in engineering terms in how much you have to build for what price and what the market will be.” According to Wozniak, Tesla’s strength is that it is based on founder Elon Musk’s vision of how he would like to see the company’s products, such as the Model function for his own usage.Read: Tesla Motors (TSLA) Slapped Down By Bank Of America, Which Says Company’s Stock Is ‘Vastly Overvalued’ After Period Of ‘Hyperbolic Growth’While Apple is now a large company with a cumulative valuation upwards of $800 billion, Tesla is valued at $68 billion. But, both companies have developed in similar ways over time.Both companies were small start-ups at one point of time, driven by the vision of a single person — in Apple’s case it was Steve Jobs and in Tesla’s case, it is Elon Musk. Both companies have disrupted the way things usually work in their respective industries. Apple was the first in the computer industry to use graphical user interfaces in PCs in the 80’s and in its second coming under the leadership of Jobs, it transformed the music player and smartphone industries, with the iPhone being the first major smartphone supportive of apps.Tesla had a similar approach to the auto industry. Musk was the first to focus attention on autonomous, electric cars not just as a concept, but rather the execution. Before Tesla, electric cars were niche products but the company made the product a mainstream one and following Tesla’s lead, most major carmakers and even tech companies are now investing in self-driving and electric automobile technology.The biggest similarity between both companies has been that their vision has been different than the prevalent norms and in most cases, way ahead of its time.But, what Wozniak is indicating isn’t wrong either. While Apple has grown considerably in terms of size, it can’t be said to be on the forefront of innovation any longer and the biggest proof of this is the company’s flagship device, the iPhone. For years, Apple’s iPhone was way ahead of its Android rivals, in terms of the features it offered. In fact, every iPhone release brought out a feature that wasn’t to be found on any Android phone, right up to the iPhone 4, which came with Siri. But the market forces have caught up with Apple and the company is no longer at the forefront of innovation.After iPhone 4, every new iPhone has had incremental or even large-scale changes in comparison to the previous generation of the device, but the device can no longer be said to be miles ahead of the competition. In fact, Android devices such the Samsung Galaxy S8, which offer features such as a 10nm processor, Bixby and Dual Audio might be way ahead of Apple in terms of features. Instead, like any large tech company, Apple is now consolidating its market share and making devices such as iPhone SE, a rehash of the iPhone 5, to cater to the budget consumer.Read: Tesla Solar Roof Tiles\' Pre-Orders To Begin Soon, US Rollout Expected This YearTesla, as Wozniak says, is a “young company” and is continuing to innovate in various areas, whether it be its cars, solar energy, space travel and even Musk’s latest obsessions – brain powered devices and tunneling machines.As tech companies mature, market factors start affecting them more and their tendency for innovation is replaced by\xa0market capitalization, as happened in Apple’s case.

Now we took action to correct that about a month ago, but that message has not filtered down to all of our customers. So there\'s still a lot of people who are under the impression that Model 3 is the upgrade from Model S.Some of these details were previously disclosed, but some are new.    Telsa Model S and Model 3 comparison. Photo: Tesla/The Motley Fool  Tesla had previously said that the Model 3 0-60 time would be ""under 6 seconds,"" so there\'s more specific detail on its performance now. After the unveiling in early 2016, there were concerns that the trunk hatch looked cramped, and Musk said Tesla would address the concerns and tweak the trunk opening. As a smaller sedan (approximately 1 foot shorter than the Model S), the Model 3 will have less than half the cargo capacity.• This Stock Could Be Like Buying Amazon in 1997Another big question has been what kind of options the Model 3 will have, particularly as the average transaction price (ATP) is expected to be around $42,000 after adding options.Musk mentioned a $42,000 ATP last year, but head of sales and service Jon McNeill suggested this month that a 20% premium is appropriate when asked about option uptake: ""And we\'ll be introducing at the start of production, I think we\'ll be announcing our vehicle -- as we get closer to the start of production what these vehicle stacks will be, but I think 20% is a fair number to use.""• 7 of 8 People Are Clueless About This Trillion-Dollar MarketThe\xa0full table\xa0implies that some of the current options on Model S won\'t make it to Model 3, like the smart air suspension and panoramic sunroof.

For starters, it\'s not really a CEO\'s job to value their own company. The most practical purpose, as far as investors are concerned, of a CEO doing so would be to assess the prospect of a share repurchase program -- something that would be inappropriate for a young company in dilutive growth mode. Musk spoke with\xa0The Guardian\xa0recently to discuss the ongoing controversy over working conditions at its Fremont factory. During the phone interview, Musk addressed Tesla\'s $50 billion market cap: ""I do believe this market cap is higher than we have any right to deserve.""That may be true, and Tesla is a uniquely difficult company to value. But Musk appears to be sending mixed messages to investors when you consider other comments he\'s made over the years.If Musk\'s comments to\xa0The Guardian\xa0sound familiar, that\'s because he made the same assessment nearly verbatim in 2013, when he said, ""The stock price that we have is more than we have any right to deserve."" Tesla shares were trading around $172 at the time.""I think our stock price is kind of high right now,"" Musk said a year later when shares were trading around $286. ""If you care about the long term, Tesla, I think the stock is a good price. If you look at the short term, it is less clear.""Meanwhile, Musk has never been one to shy away from needling the shorts:Musk also argued that short-term overvaluation is irrelevant if you\'re focused on the long-term.Speaking of the long term, he has also predicted that Tesla\'s market cap could reach anywhere from\xa0$500 billion to even $1 trillion\xa0or more.This may all sound like Orwellian doublethink, to suggest that Tesla is overvalued but could still soar 10 to 20 times higher from current levels, but the way to reconcile Musk\'s sentiments is to consider that Tesla can be overvalued in the short term but undervalued in the long term. The market may have realized this, as shares didn\'t sell off this time around on Musk conceding that current prices may be a bit lofty, which they did on some of the aforementioned previous occasions.It\'s all interrelated, though. Tesla has been able to capitalize on its soaring share price by raising the capital that it needs to fund growth while minimizing dilution relative to if shares were lower, and that capital will be utterly necessary if the company ever hopes to achieve its long-term growth targets. Executing in the long term may subsequently drive the market cap higher, although Tesla will still need to address its short-term challenges, including working conditions.Evan Niu, CFA\xa0owns shares of Tesla.\xa0The Motley Fool\xa0owns shares of and recommends Tesla.\xa0The Motley Fool\xa0has a\xa0disclosure policy.']"

Commentary ranged from an update on what level of Model S and Model X sales Musk thinks Tesla can sustain, to his thoughts about the potential for\xa0Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to buy Tesla.\xa0Here\'s some of the most notable takeaways from Tesla\'s first-quarter earnings call (by way of an S&P Capital IQ transcript).In the past, Musk has indicated that he expected annual Model S and Model X deliveries to eventually hit a steady rate of about 100,000 units annually. While the company achieved this run-rate in its most recent quarter, some investors may be wondering whether the CEO still anticipates sustaining this level of production for the two pricey vehicles as its lower-cost, higher-volume Model 3 comes to market in July.Even as Model 3\'s launch approaches, it looks as if Musk still expects annual demand for the two vehicles to stay at this rate:We\'re going to produce 100,000 units approximately, so all that matters is there\'s demand. Is there going to be demand for 100,000 units? I believe there will be. And there is.Tesla CFO Deepak Ahuja added that there is ""certainly sufficient demand"" for Tesla\'s guidance for 47,000 to 50,000 total Model S and Model X deliveries during the first half of the year.\xa0With Apple\'s cash hoard swelling to $257 billion in the company\'s most recent quarter, there\'s been some speculation that Tesla might be a good fit for a potential acquisition target for the tech giant. But Musk says Apple probably isn\'t interested anyway:I don\'t think they want to have a conversation [about buying Tesla]. I don\'t believe -- there\'s not been any indication that they do. Obviously, Apple company makes some great product. And yes, I mean, I use their phone and their laptop, it\'s cool.Musk added that he\'s unclear about what Apple wants to do ""on the car front.""Tesla has said that after its Model 3 production ramp-up, it plans to bring to market another SUV that\'s smaller than its Model X and closer in price to the $35,000 Model 3. But investors shouldn\'t expect the Model Y for another few years, Musk explained when he was asked about the company\'s goal to achieve annualized production of 1 million units annually by 2020:I think we need to come up with the Model Y sometime in 2020 or, aspirationally, late 2019. And then I think that 1 million units is quite likely -- combined, yes. Maybe more.When asked about why Tesla\'s total energy-storage megawatt hours deployed declined sequentially, Musk said the pullback in the near term is normal. But he still has high hopes for energy-storage deployment growth toward the end of the year:With respect to the battery stuff, it\'s a little lumpy right now, because you\'re at a big installation in [the] fourth quarter with\xa0Southern California Edison. And then we had a bit of a gap between the Powerwall 1 to Powerwall 2. So we should start to see that correcting in Q2 and Q3, and then particularly toward the end of this year, I would expect quite a dramatic ramp in storage deployment, like really dramatic.While Model Y may be still too far away for investors to give it much weight, and any speculation that Apple might buy Tesla might as well be ignored, investors should certainly keep an eye on demand for the Model S and X as the Model 3 comes to market.

Already covering over 1.9 million square feet in Nevada, the factory is producing cells for Tesla’s Powerwall 2 and Powerpack 2 energy products, and will start production of cells for the upcoming Model 3 in the second quarter of the year.The sprawling facility, which will have about 13 million square feet of operational space over several floors, is manufacturing the “2170 cell” — a high performance cylindrical lithium-ion cell “jointly designed and engineered by Tesla and Panasonic to offer the best performance at the lowest production cost in an optimal form factor for both electric vehicles and energy products,” according to a statement on Tesla’s website.The construction and operation of the Gigafactory is being done in phases, and the latter is currently only 30 percent done. Once complete by 2018, Tesla says it will produce 35 gWh worth of lithium-ion battery cells every year. That is an astonishing number, almost as much as the current production of all the rest of the world’s companies put together.But if Tesla wants to achieve its target of manufacturing 500,000 electric cars by 2018, it will have to achieve its Gigafactory goal as well. In 2015, it produced about 104,000 vehicles and in 2016,\xa0delivered almost 76,250. A change in hardware to incorporate full self-driving technology, put in place in mid-October, could be partly responsible for the slow production rate, but increasing it almost five times in two years is a tall order nonetheless.If things go according to plan, Tesla products may soon become a lot cheaper, which in turn could have a significant impact on adoption of clean technology.“With the Gigafactory online and ramping up production, our cost of battery cells will significantly decline due to increasing automation and process design to enhance yield, lowered capital investment per Wh of production, the simple optimization of locating most manufacturing processes under one roof, and economies of scale. By bringing down the cost of batteries, we can make our products available to more and more people, allowing us to make the biggest possible impact on transitioning the world to sustainable energy,” the company said in the statement.According to Dickson Data, production will be evenly split between cells for Powerpack 2, Powerwall 2 and Tesla vehicles. Once the facility is operating at full capacity, it will employ about 6,500 people directly and create another 20,000 to 30,000 indirect jobs in the surrounding areas.Tesla has long worked with Panasonic, its Japanese partner, for its battery technology. On Dec. 27, the two companies signed an agreement to jointly manufacture photovoltaic and other solar modules at Tesla’s factory in Buffalo, New York. In comparison to the Gigafactory, the Buffalo facility is tiny, with a plan to ramp up to 1 gigawatt of solar module production by 2019. Production at the factory is expected to start in summer 2017, and will create about 1,400 jobs.Tesla shares rose 4.61 percent Wednesday on Nasdaq, but dropped 0.15 percent during after hours trade.']"

In this case, once the update is out, Tesla customers will have to figure it out for themselves how to enable the feature that will shave off that extra tenth of a second from their acceleration.Other than the Model S, only a handful of cars (including Model X) can go from 0 to 60 miles an hour in less than 3 seconds. After the update, the Model S will be ahead of the rest, and while the car is not exactly cheap, it will do so at a fraction of the cost (think Porsche 918 Spyder, Ferrari LaFerrari and Bugatti Veyron 16.4 Grand Sport Vitesse) than its closest competitors. And the fact that it is electric makes it all that much cooler (acceleration that is faster than gravity with almost no sound).']"

He also praised those he consulted at ISS for their work pushing forward the pending deal’s new likelihood of success.“I was really impressed with the team that I met and the depth of the questions that they asked, and they spent a lot of time with Tesla and with SolarCity and with our independent Board of Directors, and then they came to a conclusion, which is fantastic,” Musk said.Shareholders will vote on the merger, which Musk called a “no-brainer” but analysts characterized as a “bailout” for SolarCity, on Nov. 17.Tesla’s shares rose Friday morning following the report’s release to a high of $193.31 from a low of $186.14, before lingering above $190 in the afternoon.

(TSLA) shares rallied Wednesday after posting its first quarterly net profit after 12 quarterly losses, trouncing estimates with the help of roughly $139 million in revenue from California clean-car credits and record production and sales.The Palo Alto, California-based\xa0company reported a third-quarter profit of $21.9 million, or 14 cents per share. Revenue more than doubled to $2.3 billion from $936.8 million for the same period last year, and far exceeded Thomson Reuters analysts’ consensus estimates, which forecasted $1.98 billion in sales.Since the company went public in June 2010, it’s only other profitable quarter was the first quarter of 2013.The electric car maker’s revenue was aided by net orders for Model S, a sedan, and Model X, a luxury sports utility, which grew a combined 68 percent year-over-year. Model X captured 6 percent of the coveted U.S. SUV market. Tesla also achieved record production of 25,185 vehicles, which marks a 37 percent increase from the second quarter and a 92 percent increase from the first quarter.Tesla’s $139 million in tax credits was a sharp gain from $39 million for the same quarter last year.The company’s price of shares opened Wednesday at $201.00 and climbed in after-hour trading to 211.00, its highest level since Oct. 5. Earlier this month, Goldman Sachs downgraded Tesla from a ""buy"" to a ""neutral.""“It’s definitely one of the best moments in Tesla’s history,” chairman and CEO Elon Musk said about the quarter in a conference call. “I think we’re headed to have a great fourth quarter as well. I currently believe (the fourth quarter) will be profitable excluding stock expenses.”Meanwhile, Musk said there was no new capital needed for the Model 3, a sedan with a starting price of $35,000—roughly half the price of the Model S. The Model 3 will roll out in the second half of 2017.Turning a profit for the quarter could help the proposed merger of SolarCity (SCTY), a solar power maker based in San Mateo, California, in which Musk is the chairman and principal shareholder. In June, Musk proposed Tesla buying SolarCity for about $2.45 billion, with a merger vote taking place on Nov. 17.After the proposed deal, independent research team Argus had downgraded Tesla from a ""buy"" to a ""hold.""']"

Musk said on Wednesday Tesla is building new vehicles with the necessary hardware to eventually enable full autonomy, although the software is not yet ready.""Please note that using a self-driving Tesla for car sharing and ride hailing for friends and family is fine, but doing so for revenue purposes will only be permissible on the Tesla Network, details of which will be released next year,"" read the disclaimer.Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for more detail.Car makers have rushed to invest in so-called mobility services, hoping to capture the potential trillions of dollars in revenue from selling both vehicles and such on-demand services, while carving out a stake in the industry dominated by Uber UBER.UL.Barclays analyst Brian Johnson wrote in a note to investors on Thursday that although a Tesla Network could ""excite the market"" over its potential earnings stream, it was a costly proposition.""While we think ride-sharing/hailing is the future of mass-market mobility, we have some financial concerns with the idea of an OEM-owned fleet,"" Johnson wrote.Venture capitalists and corporate investors had poured nearly $28 billion into the ride services sector in the past decade as of June, according to a Reuters analysis.General Motors has made the biggest bet, investing $500 million in Lyft in January.

Musk also said that retrofitting existing Tesla cars with full self-driving hardware is both difficult and expensive, making it cheaper and simpler to buy a new vehicle instead.Musk’s series of tweets began with a video — set to the Rolling Stones’ “Paint It Black” — that shows a Model S driving through urban city streets, onto a highway, back to the streets and finding itself a parking spot. The video shows various camera angles the car uses to read its surroundings intercut with shots from inside the car. When the man sitting behind the wheel (only for legal reasons) reaches his destination, he gets out while the car parks itself. The car stops for someone walking across the parking lot and also reads parking signs to detect eligible spots, thereby skipping a spot reserved for disabled people.Another cool feature is the new “Summon” button available on the Tesla smartphone app. In a move reminiscent of the Batmobile, tapping that button will literally send a signal to the car, which will drive itself to wherever you (and your phone) are. Theoretically and given enough charge, it is possible even from one coast to the other.Musk also tweeted about the prototype of an automatic metal snake charger, first seen in 2015, that finds the charging spot in the Tesla vehicles on its own.']"
https://www.ibtimes.com/tesla-motors-tsla-announcement-full-autonomy-capable-hardware-all-cars-being-produced-2434345,Tesla Motors (TSLA) Announcement: Full Autonomy-Capable Hardware In All Cars Being Produced Now,Himanshu Goenka,10/20/16,1:33 AM,"['In an announcement delayed by three days, Tesla Motors said Wednesday all its vehicles now in production — including the upcoming Model 3 — will have hardware that is capable of fully-autonomous driving. According to Tesla, full self-driving capability will provide “a safety level substantially greater than that of a human driver.”So what does this new full autonomy-capable hardware consist of?First, there are cameras and sensors to collect data. A complete 360-degree vision is provided by eight cameras around the car that have a range of up to 250 meters. Taking further the company’s strategy of reduced reliance on cameras alone, 12 ultrasonic sensors — whose range has been updated to “nearly twice the distance of the prior system” — detect both hard and soft objects. And then, there is a forward-facing radar that can see through dust, fog, rain and so on, as well as the vehicle ahead.To process all this data, which is far more than a single person can collect — even if he or she could sense wavelengths beyond human abilities — the new onboard computer has more than 40 times the processing power of the previous generation.However, while the Elon Musk-owned company calibrates the new system “to ensure significant improvements to safety and convenience,” Tesla vehicles with the new hardware will lack some safety features that are available in vehicles with the older hardware, the announcement said. Some of these features include automatic emergency braking, collision warning, lane holding and active cruise control.As the company uses data from millions of real-world driving miles to validate the existing safety features, as well as entirely new ones made possible by the use of the new hardware, it will roll them out and activate them through over-the-air updates.The Model X and Model S vehicles with the new hardware are already available for purchase.The announcement was supposed to be made on Sunday, but according to Musk, it was delayed while the company worked on a video of a Tesla vehicle (presumably with the new hardware) “navigating a complex urban environment.”Musk also plans to showcase a Tesla vehicle making a cross-country trip, from Los Angeles to New York, in fully autonomous mode, by the end of 2017, the Wall Street Journal reported.']"

Even though the over-the-air release came just a few hours later than CEO Elon Musk had announced on Twitter on Wednesday morning, customers will likely not be complaining.On its website, Tesla calls the update “a significant over-the-air overhaul of the Tesla touchscreen. This release combines a modern interface and more intuitive Media Player with display improvements for Maps and Autopilot.”The Autopilot update is perhaps the most significant for the company, as well as its customers. The update, apart from increasing the use of radar imaging — announced by Tesla on Sept. 11 — which will make the self-driving system more accurate, also introduces a new safety feature that disables the vehicle’s auto-steering if the driver ignores safety warnings. This is consistent with the luxury electric car maker insisting that Autopilot is not a fully autonomous driving system, and that drivers must pay attention to the road at all times.Other smaller updates to Autopilot include increased responsiveness in stop-and-go traffic, showing the direction of vehicles on the instrument panel and redesigned Autopilot indicators.The map interface has been expanded to cover the entire touchscreen, allowing drivers to see more content at one time as the zoom adjusts itself based on locations and the “control bar fades automatically for an uncluttered navigation experience.” Searching for destinations can be done with a single tap or voice command, and a single swipe can navigate to preset home and work destinations.Another important improvement is the temperature control focused on safety of children and/or pets left in the car. The Cabin Overheat Protection ""feature keeps the car at a safe temperature for hours, even when the car is off, and is made possible by our uniquely large battery packs,” according to Tesla. Musk revealed the temperature will be kept below 105 degrees Fahrenheit “by automatically venting cabin & turning on AC when needed.”There are also enhancements to the media player, which has been redesigned, and to the voice commands system, which has made voice controls clearer.']"

Tesla Motors said Tuesday it had updated the software in its vehicles through an over-the-air release.Cybersecurity researchers from Keen Security Lab, a part of Chinese behemoth Tencent Holdings, published a blog post and a video Monday that detailed their remote hacking of a Model S car that had not been modified at all. The video showed the sunroof being opened, the steering lamp blinking and the driver’s seat being moved remotely in a parked vehicle, as well as its door being opened without a key. It also suggested that the researchers took control of the car when it was searching for the nearest charging station.The responsible hackers, who shared their research with Tesla, also showed what they could do with a moving car. The car’s front wipers, rearview mirrors and the trunk could all be operated remotely, and even the brakes could be applied by a researcher who was 12 miles away.In a statement shared with media outlets, Tesla said: “Within just 10 days of receiving this report, Tesla has already deployed an over-the-air software update (v7.1, 2.36.31) that addresses the potential security issues. The issue demonstrated is only triggered when the web browser is used, and also required the car to be physically near to and connected to a malicious wifi hotspot. Our realistic estimate is that the risk to our customers was very low, but this did not stop us from responding quickly.”Tesla also lauded the Keen team, and said it would be\xa0rewarded for finding the bugs.“We engage with the security research community to test the security of our products so that we can fix potential vulnerabilities before they result in issues for our customers. We commend the research team behind today's demonstration and plan to reward them under our bug bounty program, which was set up to encourage this type of research,” the company said.""]"

On Wednesday, Tesla’s erstwhile partner in its Autopilot development, Israeli chipmaker Mobileye, said it had decided to split with the Elon Musk-owned company because of concerns over Autopilot, with Tesla “pushing the envelope in terms of safety.”Speaking to Reuters, Mobileye Chairman Amnon Shashua said of Autopilot: “It is not designed to cover all possible crash situations in a safe manner. ... No matter how you spin it, [Autopilot] is not designed for that. It is a driver assistance system and not a driverless system.”In response, a Tesla spokeswoman had initially said the company never advertised its Autopilot as a self-driving technology or its cars as autonomous vehicles.“We’ve continuously educated customers on the use of the features, reminding them that they’re responsible to keep their hands on the wheel and remain alert and present when using Autopilot,” she said.Musk had even expressed concerns over drivers doing “crazy things” after seeing videos of drivers taking their hands off the steering for several minutes at a time while driving on highways.However, on Thursday, Tesla went a step further and hinted that the split between the companies was a result of jealousy on the part of Mobileye, rather than safety concerns. A spokeswoman told Los Angeles Times that when Mobileye discovered Tesla was developing its own video-processing system, it tried to “force Tesla to discontinue this development, pay them more, and use their products in future hardware.”When Tesla refused to comply, the spokeswoman said, the Israeli company “discontinued hardware support for future platforms and released public statements implying that this discontinuance was motivated by safety concerns.”Mobileye stuck to its stance, however. Its chief communications officer, Dan Galves, said: “The reasons stated for the breakup are absolutely primarily the reason the relationship ended. Were there commercial issues going on at the time? Yes, but those probably shouldn’t be discussed publicly.”The rift between the two companies has been relatively public since it began in late July. Soon after the split was announced — by Mobileye — Musk said their parting ways was “inevitable” since the vision system supplier was unable to keep pace with the product changes Tesla was making.Musk announced an update to Autopilot on Sunday, which shifts the bulk of its on-road data gathering to radars instead of cameras, a move he says will make the system safer and would likely prevent some of the crashes the Tesla Model S has been involved in recent months.Meanwhile, according to reports in Chinese media, the first fatal crash involving a Tesla Model S was not the one in Florida in May. Instead, the incident, caught on the vehicle’s dashcam, took place somewhere in the Hong Kong and Macau jurisdiction in China, all the way back in January.Mobileye is now working with BMW and Intel on another self-driving car, an announcement that predates its split with Tesla.']"

The range for the Model S sedan, equipped with the P100D battery, is now 315 miles, nearly a 17 percent jump which makes it the electric car with the longest range currently available.Does that mean Tesla has the best battery technology available in the world today? Not necessarily.Scientists at the Ohio State University (OSU) have developed battery technology that could give electric vehicles more mileage for every minute of charging. In a statement, the researchers said electric cars have hit a “performance limit because of how charge is stored in conventional batteries.” They put that limit at 0.4 miles of driving for every minute of charge (though it would seem that Tesla’s P100D battery does better with about 0.6 miles at its best).“Inspired by how living cell membranes transport proteins” in the human body, Vishnu-Baba Sundaresan and Travis Hery from OSU “have designed a thin plastic membrane that stops rechargeable batteries from discharging when not in use and allows for rapid recharging.”Current batteries, like the popular lithium-ion ones, already have membranes but they can’t completely prevent the leakage of charge from batteries, which happens through an internal chemical process known as self-discharge. This phenomenon causes a gradual power drain from the battery. The scientists hope their invention, which they are calling an “ionic redox transistor,” will increase the capacity of “car batteries to provide up to tens of miles per minute of charge.”Sundaresan said: “That’s still an order of magnitude away from the equivalent measure in gasoline, but it’s a place to start.”    Prototype membranes developed by engineers at the Ohio State University to help rechargeable batteries be more efficient and to keep them from catching fire. Photo: Pam Frost Gorder/The Ohio State University  The self-discharge, in worst-case scenarios, can generate enough heat to start a fire, as happened in the recent cases of Boeing’s Dreamliner fleet or with some hoverboards.The researchers are using their transistor “to develop a new kind of battery in which energy is stored in a liquid electrolyte — which people can recharge or empty out and refill as they would refill a gas tank.” This would allow extending the driving range even beyond a single charge without needing to stop for a recharge. It would also provide for a mechanism to prevent the heating issues caused by self-discharge.During lab tests, the researchers “found that their membrane reliably controlled charging and discharging in batteries powered by ions of lithium, sodium and potassium.”The research, funded by the National Science Foundation, was published in the journal Energy and Environment Science.']"

The incident, which marked the first fatality involving a self-driving car, triggered concerns over the safety of Tesla\'s crash-avoidance and autopilot systems, and is now being investigated by the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration.According to an unnamed source cited by Reuters, Tesla officials told committee members that braking failure is not the same as a malfunction in its autopilot system, which manages steering, changing lanes, adaptive cruise control and several other features meant to prevent accidents. However, the exact distinction between the two systems was not made clear.""Those systems are supposed to work together to prevent an accident,"" Karl Brauer, a senior analyst at the auto research firm Kelley Blue Book, told the New York Times. “But either the car didn’t know it had to stop, or it did know and wasn’t able to stop. That involves Autopilot and the automatic braking.""The information presented at the meeting will do little to dispel enduring concerns about Tesla\'s Autopilot — a feature that the company has hailed as ""better than human.""""Autopilot is a key component of the image Tesla wants to project,"" Brauer told the Times. ""They’ve made a big deal about it. So they don’t want to be in the position of saying that there’s something wrong with something that’s part of the whole company’s image.""According to Reuters, Tesla officials are still trying to determine \xa0whether the car’s radar and camera input for the emergency braking system failed to detect the truck, or whether it detected but misidentified it as an overpass, road sign or a bridge — structures it is built to ""tune out.""""What we know is that the vehicle was on a divided highway with Autopilot engaged when a tractor trailer drove across the highway perpendicular to the Model S. Neither Autopilot nor the driver noticed the white side of the tractor trailer against a brightly lit sky, so the brake was not applied,"" Tesla wrote in a June 30 blog post. ""Had the Model S impacted the front or rear of the trailer, even at high speed, its advanced crash safety system would likely have prevented serious injury as it has in numerous other similar incidents.""']"

He took to Twitter on July 10 to let his more than 4 million followers know that he was working on a “master plan.” Without revealing much about what he has in mind, Musk managed to tantalize his followers with minor tidbits for 10 days, before unveiling an ambitious plan Wednesday to expand the company into electric trucks and buses, ride-sharing business and solar energy systems.Musk wrote a blog post, titled “Master Plan, Part Deux,” on the company’s website to share his vision of an integrated carbon-free energy enterprise that would offer a wider range of vehicles, products and services beyond electric cars and batteries that Tesla has been working on over the years. Musk also explained why the integration of Tesla and SolarCity Corp., where he is a major shareholder, is necessary to achieve his goals.“We can't do this well if Tesla and SolarCity are different companies, which is why we need to combine and break down the barriers inherent to being separate companies,” the South African-born Canadian-American business magnate wrote. “Now that Tesla is ready to scale Powerwall and SolarCity is ready to provide highly differentiated solar, the time has come to bring them together.”Musk said he wanted to use the technology of SolarCity, a San Mateo, California-based rooftop solar panel installer, to help charge an expanding range of Tesla’s electric vehicles, addressing both personal and public transport as well as cargo shipping. According to him, the new vehicles will include a commercial truck called the “Tesla Semi,” which “will deliver a substantial reduction in the cost of cargo transport,” a public transport bus, a new kind of pickup truck and a compact SUV.“There are two other types of electric vehicles needed: heavy-duty trucks and high passenger-density urban transport. Both are in the early stages of development at Tesla and should be ready for unveiling next year,” Musk wrote, without providing details on how the new projects would be financed.In addition, Musk also talked about the company’s ambitions for a ride-sharing business. According to him, Tesla will continue to pursue self-driving car technology, which will one day enable the company’s customers to use their cars for ride-sharing “to make money for you when you aren’t using it.”“You will also be able to add your car to the Tesla shared fleet just by tapping a button on the Tesla phone app and have it generate income for you while you're at work or on vacation, significantly offsetting and at times potentially exceeding the monthly loan or lease cost,” Must wrote.However, some analysts are not convinced, and think that Musk’s plan of adding more products to Tesla’s lineup is far-fetched.“Tesla’s latest Master Plan includes expanding its electric vehicle product line to cover all major segments, when it hasn’t been meeting production targets with the limited product line it has now and in the next couple of years.” Michelle Krebs, an analyst for Autotrader.com Inc., told Bloomberg in an email, adding that Musk’s “master plan” did not detail how and when Tesla will be profitable.In May, Tesla sold nearly $1.7 billion in new shares to fund projects, including development of the company’s new Model 3 car lineup. Some part of that amount is also expected to be utilized to speed up production of 500,000 vehicles a year by 2018, Reuters reported.Musk announced earlier this month that the company increased its production in the second quarter of 2016 by 20 percent, compared with the January-March period, producing just short of 2,000 cars per week. However, with only 14,370 vehicles delivered during the April-June quarter, the company fell well short of its initial target of 17,000 deliveries. In the first quarter of this year, Tesla Motors delivered 14,810 vehicles.""]"

With continued productivity improvements, Tesla expects output to reach 2,200 vehicles per week in Q3 and 2,400 vehicles per week in Q4.”The automaker added that the current and projected production levels are in line with “current order rate trends and backlog.” However, Tesla seems to be having a difficult time getting the produced cars from the manufacturing plant to its customers.It delivered only 14,370 vehicles — 9,745 Model S and 4,625 Model X — during the second quarter, falling well short of its stated target of 17,000 deliveries and declining from the 14,810 vehicles it delivered during the previous quarter. The quarter was the second consecutive one where the company fell short of its delivery targets.Tesla cited its increased production and a very high number of vehicles in transit as the reasons for lower deliveries. It said 5,150 vehicles were on their way to customers at the end of June, and were expected to be delivered early in the ongoing third quarter. The automaker expects to produce and deliver 50,000 vehicles in the last six months of 2016, the statement added. The total deliveries for the year will certainly fall short of the company’s target of between 80,000 and 90,000 vehicles.The company has been increasing its production as it prepares to meet the production deadline for Model 3, its mass market sedan, which was ambitiously brought forward by two years.The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration launched an investigation into the 2015 Tesla Model S last week after a driver was involved in a fatal crash while using the car’s “Autopilot” self-drive feature, the most advanced of its kind used in commercial cars yet.The company’s stock took a hit a couple of weeks ago when CEO Musk announced a $2.86 billion all-stock offer to buy SolarCity Corp., where Musk is chairman and largest shareholder.

By contrast, Tesla already has more than 370,000 orders for its Model 3.To help improve sales, BMW (BMWG.DE) is increasing the battery range of its i3 city vehicle by 50 percent this year.Its next full-fledged new electric car model is not due until 2021, but the Bavarian auto maker is also planning to build a new version of its i3 electric car to be released by 2018, a source familiar with the matter said.""It is a sportier brother for the i3,"" said the source, who declined to be named.Rival Tesla (TSLA.O) is due to release its Model 3 in 2017, and as rivals Porsche and Audi are working on all-electric cars for release by 2019.A new BMW flagship model with autonomous driving capabilities will follow in 2021. As a result, Froehlich is increasing the proportion of software and technology experts.Today, software engineers make up just 20 percent of the 30,000 employees, contractors and suppliers that work on research and development for BMW. Within the next five years, BMW wants to raise that proportion to 50 percent of overall R&D staff.In an interview at the company\'s headquarters in Munich, BMW board member Klaus Froehlich, who is in charge of development, said he reorganized company-wide research and development in April.""It is now in ramp-up stage. We call it Project `i Next\'.""As part of its push in autonomous driving, BMW is hiring experts in machine learning and artificial intelligence. It is also integrating the functions of existing computer-driven assistance systems like cruise control, emergency braking, lane-keeping support and automatic parking.The revamp follows high-profile staff defections from the ""i"" electric car division this year.

That would give carmakers a competitive edge over ride-hailing companies like Uber [UBER.UL] and Lyft, which are eroding car sales by making part-time use as convenient as ownership.Earlier this month, Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T) said it would invest in Uber, and Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) announced a $300 million investment in Gett, a smaller ride-sharing company.BMW may partner with a ride-hailing firm, too, particularly in markets like China. But the Bavarian carmaker is still working on its strategy on potential partnerships with such companies, Froehlich said.Sales of highly autonomous vehicles - those where permanent active input from the driver is not required - are not expected to take off until 2020. But they could then rise to around 9 million a year by 2025, according to analysts at Exane BNP Paribas.China, the world\'s largest car market, is likely to be the market where autonomous cars will first emerge on a large scale, Froehlich said.""China is extremely fast implementing technology. Last year more electric cars were sold in China than in all the other global markets combined,"" he added.BMW is also considering expanding in the area of reserving parking spaces and electric car-charging stations over mobile phones, a market which is still fragmented within countries.

Now the company appears to be laying the groundwork for the infrastructure and related software crucial to powering such a product.The moves show Apple responding to a key shortcoming of electric vehicles (EVs): recharging the batteries. A shortage of public charging stations and the hours wasted in charging a car could represent an opportunity for the company, whose simple designs have transformed consumer electronics.Apple has never publicly acknowledged a car project, and it declined to comment for this story. Neither the LinkedIn profiles nor sources said specifically that the company was building charging stations for electric cars.But automotive sources last year told Reuters that Apple was studying a self-driving EV, as the Silicon Valley icon looks for new sources of revenue amid a maturing market for its iPhone.Apple is now asking charging station companies about their underlying technology, one person with knowledge of the matter said. The talks, which have not been reported, do not concern charging the electric cars of Apple employees, a service the company already provides. They indicate the firm is focused on producing a car, the person added.Charging firms are treading carefully, the person said, wary of sharing too much with an outfit they view as a potential rival.It is unclear whether Apple would want its own proprietary technology, such as Tesla Motors’ Supercharger network, or to design a system compatible with offerings of other market players.Several charging station suppliers contacted by Reuters declined to comment about any dealings with Apple, which typically requires potential partners to sign nondisclosure agreements.Arun Banskota, president of NRG Energy’s electric vehicle charging business, EVgo, did not respond directly to questions about Apple, but said repeatedly his company was “in discussions with every manufacturer of today and every potential manufacturer of tomorrow.”Apple has also hired at least four EV charging specialists, including former Bayerische Motoren Werke (BMW) employee Rónán Ó Braonáin, who worked on integrating charging infrastructure into home energy systems as well as communication between EVs, BMW and utilities, according to a LinkedIn review.As recently as January, Apple hired Nan Liu, an engineer who researched a form of wireless charging for EVs, for instance. And Quartz reported this month that Apple had hired former Google charging expert Kurt Adelberger.EV charging stations are manufactured, installed and operated under varying business models. Players in the space include private companies such as ChargePoint and ClipperCreek, public utilities, infrastructure companies such as Black & Veatch and Aecom as well as General Electric, Siemens and Delta Electronics.Charger ShortfallThe electric car industry has faced a chicken-and-egg paradox with the installation of charging stations. Property owners have been reluctant to install them before EVs hit the road en masse, and drivers are wary of buying EVs until charging stations are widely available.Apple’s home state of California by 2020 will need about 13 to 25 times the roughly 8,000 work and public chargers it currently has to support a projected 1 million zero-emission vehicles on the road, according to an estimate by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory.Tesla recently goosed EV demand, unveiling its comparatively affordable Model 3 sedan, generating hundreds of thousands of reservations by potential buyers and leading many experts to calculate the number of EVs will soon outstrip the charging station supply.Tesla also has led the way with a proprietary network for customers, who also can use public chargers. Its more than 600 Supercharger stations juice up a car in about 30 minutes, more than twice as fast as the standard fast charger called Level 2.One global engineering and construction company already has reached out to Apple to offer its services, a person at the firm said.“It would be natural to assume if Apple is going to have a full battery electric vehicle that creates a seamless consumer experience the way Apple does, the charging infrastructure and its availability would be of paramount importance,” the source said.']"

Deutsche Bank, Citibank\xa0and Bank of America Merrill Lynch\xa0will also participate.The announcement came just hours before Goldman Sachs issued a research note upgrading the company’s stock to “buy” based on improved U.S. macroeconomic conditions and a higher-than-expected volume of preorders for the $35,000 Model 3 sedan, due out in late 2017.“We think diminished concerns about a recession provide a bit more downside protection than in February, as does the near 400k in reservations, which validate the long-term demand picture in our view,” the note said. Goldman set a six-month target price of $250 per share, up from around $211 on Wednesday.In its first-quarter letter to shareholders, Tesla said it expected its level of capital expenditures for the year to increase from $1.5 billion to about $1.75 billion as it moved forward its target of building 500,000 cars to 2018 instead of 2020. The move came after the company received nearly 400,000 Model 3 preorders.For months analysts have speculated that Tesla would either borrow more money or look to the markets for more capital. The company ended March with $1.44 billion in cash and equivalents and $3.19 billion in short-term liabilities, meaning payments that come due within 12 months.Tesla’s share price rose following the release of the Goldman note early Wednesday and ended the regular trading session\xa0up 3.18 percent at\xa0$211.17.

Neither visa is designed to bring in laborers like Lesnik.Recruited by ISM Vuzem, a small Slovenian company, and employed by Eisenmann, a German-based manufacturer that was hired by Tesla to build the paint shop at the factory, these workers were paid as little as $5 an hour for\xa0jobs that local workers would typically demand 10\xa0times the amount to do, the newspaper said.Lesnik, who was injured in an accident at the site, was brought to the U.S. for months at a time. He lived in communal housing with his co-workers and worked six or seven days a week. Tesla denies it was aware that Eisenmann had retained the workers hired by ISM Vuzem.An electrician like Lesnik would fall under a visa category known as H-2B\xa0for\xa0laborers like welders and electricians. The visa is difficult to acquire because there’s an annual limit on the number that can be issued.Labor rights advocates have long argued that the government isn’t vetting these visa applications closely enough, which allows recruiters and intermediaries to game the system to bring in cheaper labor.\xa0Tesla is\xa0investing $1.75 billion this year on numerous projects, including expanding the capacity of its factory production.']"

(TSLA) Shares Fall As Company Says It Will Spend More In 2016 Than Previously Stated To Speed Up Production,Angelo Young,05/05/16,5:16 PM,"['Tesla Motors Inc. shares dropped Thursday after investors digested the company’s first quarter sales report saying the company will spend more than previously stated this year to speed up production of the Model 3, the company’s lower-priced electric sedan.The share price rose in after-hours trading Wednesday and opened higher Thursday, but by the end of trading was 5 percent lower, to $211.53, a nearly two-month low. It extended losses after the closing bell in New York.In its first quarter 2016 shareholder letter, Tesla said it plans to build 500,000 cars a year by 2018 instead of 2020 after it received hundreds of thousands of pre-orders within days of unveiling a working prototype of the $35,000 Model 3.The new production schedule wipes out the company’s previously stated forecast of turning a profit based on generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, by the fourth quarter and increases the likelihood Tesla will need to raise more money sooner.During the fourth quarter 2015 conference call, CEO Elon Musk said he expected his company to be “profitable by GAAP standards in Q4\xa0of this year.” But on Thursday, Musk and Chief Financial Officer Jason Wheeler\xa0said in their letter to shareholders they now anticipate spending about $2.25 billion this year, up from a previous forecast of $1.5 billion.“Given our plans to advance our 500,000 total unit build plan, essentially doubling the prior growth plan, we are re-evaluating our level of capital expenditures, but expect it will be about 50 percent higher than our previous guidance of $1.5 billion for 2016,” the letter said. “Naturally, this will impact our ability to be net cash flow positive for the year, but given the demand for Model 3, investing to meet that demand is the best long-term decision for Tesla.”Deutsche Bank automotive equity analyst Rod Lache said Thursday in a note the company’s “propensity for aggressive projections” suggests it may not reach the 500,000 target by 2018. He maintained his “hold” rating on Tesla, but raised his 12-month price target to $290 from $280.Tesla’s shares fell Wednesday before the earnings report was released after Bloomberg news reported the departure of two high-level executives. The company has seen an increase in executive exits in the past year.']"

Tesla maintained its target of at least 80,000 unit sales for the year, and also said it’s moving its target of building 500,000 cars from 2020\xa0to 2018.“Increasing production five\xa0fold over the next two years will be challenging and will likely require some additional capital, but this is our goal, and we will be working hard to achieve it,” CEO Elon Musk and Chief Financial Officer Jason Wheeler said in a letter to shareholders released after markets closed Wednesday in New York.The company’s stock price (NASDAQ:TSLA) gained 4.7 percent to $22.56 after the closing bell, erasing losses for the day that came after\xa0news of two executive departures linked to production problems with the Model X utility vehicle.Tesla’s earnings report can be tricky, because the company’s numbers vary significantly between its pro forma numbers, which exclude certain expenses, and the figures it’s required to report to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.Tesla reported a GAAP loss of $282.3 million, or $2.13 per share, compared to a loss of $154.2 million, or $1.22 per share, in the same quarter last year. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters ahead of the earnings release had expected a GAAP loss of $77.7 million or 86 cents per share, so the company had a huge miss there.But Tesla’s first quarter adjusted (non-GAAP) loss was $75.3 million, or 57 cents per share, wider than the $45.3 million, or, 36 cents per share in the first quarter last year. The Wall Street consensus was for a loss of $83.7 million, or 58 cents per share. (Adjusted losses remove stock-based compensation, interest on borrowing and the way the company accounts for leased cars.) The earnings beat, as it’s called, is what sent the stock price upward after the bell.Tesla also met revenue estimates for the first three months of the year, of $1.6 billion compared to $1.1 billion in the year-ago quarter. Meeting revenue expectations is one of the most vital metrics because it reveals sales growth for an otherwise non-profitable, money-bleeding company.The increasing use of so-called non-GAAP (or pro forma) figures is facing increased scrutiny from regulators for the way\xa0companies\xa0define “one-time charges,” including executive stock-based compensation and —\xa0in Tesla’s case —\xa0the way it books profit from vehicle leases under its buyback guarantee, which poses measurable risk if the company can’t sell pre-owned cars for the price it expects in the future.The earnings release came hours after Bloomberg reported the departures of Greg Reichow, Tesla's vice president of production, and Josh Ensign, vice president of manufacturing. The executive exits are related to delays and production problems with the Model X utility vehicle, which was highlighted in a Consumer Reports article last month.Jim Chanos, a well-known short-seller (investors who\xa0profit when company share prices fall), later went on CNBC to say Tesla’s string of executive departures is a red flag. Other executives, including James Chen, vice president of regulatory affairs, and Ricardo Reyes, vice president of global communications, have left the company.“One of our historical signposts is when numbers of senior people leave over a short period of time,” Chanos\xa0told the news network. “Tesla fits that bill. We have a chart of senior executives leaving Tesla;\xa0it is a flood in the last few years. This is not just Model X;\xa0these people are going to be needed for the Model 3.”""]"
https://www.ibtimes.com/two-tesla-motors-inc-tsla-manufacturing-executives-leaving-electric-car-maker-2364136,Two Tesla Motors Inc. (TSLA) Manufacturing Executives Leaving Electric Car Maker,IBT Staff Report,05/04/16,2:07 PM,"['This story was updated at 4:10 p.m. EDT.Two top manufacturing executives are leaving Tesla Motors Inc. as the Silicon Valley electric-car maker prepares to launch its first mass-market car, the Model 3, and sharply ramp up production.The departures follow a rocky production start for the company\'s Model X sport utility vehicle, a technology-heavy crossover that faced problems including parts shortages and quality issues, such as non-fastening doors.Tesla\'s vice president of production, Greg Reichow, has chosen to take a leave of absence for a ""well-earned break,"" a Tesla spokesperson said. Chief Executive Elon Musk said Reichow and his team deserved credit for ""building an all-new manufacturing organization from the ground up"" and making the Model S sedan and Model X a reality.Reichow, who has led production for the past three years and has been employed for five years at Tesla, will stay on until a successor is found to ensure a ""smooth handoff,"" the company said.Tesla also confirmed its vice president of manufacturing, Josh Ensign, has left the company.Tesla says the Model X issues have been resolved and production of the SUV, which began deliveries in September, is now on track.The company hopes to produce 500,000 vehicles annually by 2020, led by its hotly anticipated Model 3, which is to be priced around $35,000 and due to begin production at the end of 2017.Some analysts question whether the company will be able to handle a ten-fold increase in production, given demand for the Model 3, which has already received more than 325,000 reservations in the month following its unveiling on March 31.Tesla is due to announce first-quarter results later on Wednesday.Tesla co-founder, Chairman and CEO Elon Musk may not mention the company’s stock price when it gives its latest financial update, but it will be front and center in the minds of investors divided over its seemingly rich valuation.After a rally that ground to a halt in April, Tesla’s market capitalization is currently about $31 billion — equivalent to either $620,000 for every car it delivered last year or $63,000 for every car it hopes to produce in 2020.By comparison, General Motors’ $48 billion market value is equivalent to about $4,800 for every vehicle it sold last year.Tesla’s heady valuation, about 125 times its\xa0expected earnings during the next 12 months, and the implication that shareholders may be overpaying for Musk’s small but fast-growing luxury car company have made the stock a favorite of short sellers.Short sellers first borrow shares and then sell them, hoping to buy them back later at a cheaper price.Tesla is among the world’s 10 most-shorted companies by market value, even after an 85 percent rally this year scalded some of its short sellers. In the past month, short bets against Tesla fell by more than $1 billion, but are still above $6 billion, according to financial analytics firm S3 Partners in New York.Data from Reuters were used to report this story.']"

Air Bag Recall: Japanese Manufacturer Recalling Up To 40 Million More Inflators In US Vehicles,IBT Staff Report,05/04/16,11:36 AM,"['This story was updated at 2:15 p.m. EDT.The U.S. Department of Transportation’s National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said Wednesday it is expanding and accelerating its recall of Takata air bag inflators.The agency said it is requiring\xa0Takata to recall\xa035 million to 40 million additional inflators in U.S. vehicles, in addition to the 28.8 million inflators previously recalled. The expanded recall, which is planned to take place in phases between May 2016 and December 2019, will more than double what is already the largest and most complex auto safety recall in U.S. history.\xa0Previously, 14 automakers had recalled 24 million vehicles with 28.8 million inflators linked to at least 11 deaths and more than 100 injuries.NHTSA said its decision ""follows the agency\'s confirmation of the root cause behind the inflators\' propensity to rupture.""A NHTSA official said Tesla Motors Inc., Fisker Automotive and Jaguar Land Rover will recall vehicles for Takata air bag inflators.In recent days, officials from the NHTSA told Takata it needs to expand the recall based on the government\'s determination of the root cause of the problems, sources briefed on the matter said.“Today’s action is a significant step in the U.S. Department of Transportation’s aggressive oversight of Takata on behalf of drivers and passengers across America,” Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx said. “The acceleration of this recall is based on scientific evidence and will protect all Americans from air bag inflators that may become unsafe.”The expansions mean that all Takata ammonium nitrate-based propellant driver and passenger frontal air bag inflators without a chemical drying agent, known as a desiccant, will be recalled.The use of a drying agent is key, as the New York Times reported Tuesday:At issue is Takata’s use of a compound called ammonium nitrate, which can become unstable over time or when it is exposed to moisture. Takata has wrestled with the makeup of the compound over the years, eventually adding a drying agent to make it more stable. The new recalls focus on airbags that do not have the drying agent.Scott Upham, founder and chief executive of the automotive consulting firm Valient Market Research, said that the wider recall was an admission by Takata that its use of ammonium nitrate — a cheap, but potent, compound more often used at large-scale sites like coal mines — was a safety risk.The new recalls will prioritized by age and risk of exposure to high humidity and phased in through 2019. It comes as automakers are still working to get enough supply of replacement parts to meet the current demand for recalls.There are no deaths linked to any of the new inflators being recalled. Agency officials said at a briefing that they did not believe there are any injuries linked to the new air bag inflators being recalled.Last month, NHTSA said there were about 85 million unrecalled Takata air bag inflators in U.S. vehicles that would need to be recalled by 2019 unless the company can prove they are safe.NHTSA and its outside expert reviewed the findings of three independent investigations into the Takata air bag ruptures and confirmed the findings on the root cause of inflator ruptures. A combination of time, environmental moisture and fluctuating high temperatures contribute to the degradation of the ammonium nitrate propellant in the inflators.The recall expansion does not include additional inflators that include a chemical desiccant that absorbs moisture. There have been no reported ruptures of the desiccated inflators, but NHTSA Administrator Mark Rosekind said the agency could order a recall if new facts emerged.Data from Reuters were used to report this story.']"

(TSLA) Q1 Earnings Preview: Look For CEO Elon Musk To Discuss Progress On Model X Deliveries, Model 3 Update",Angelo Young,05/03/16,2:32 PM,"[""UPDATE: Click here for Tesla Motors' first quarter earnings numbers.\xa0It’s been nearly five weeks since Tesla Motors unveiled its $35,000 Model 3, setting off an avalanche of preorders, an immense amount of online chatter about the electric compact sedan and a windfall of much-needed cash. On Wednesday, the world will get the latest update on developments from the 13-year-old Silicon Valley electric car company when it releases its financial results for the three months ended March 31.The big question for the quarter will be progress with the Model X sport utility vehicle that began to trickle into the\xa0U.S. market in the last three months of 2015. The pace of Model X production was slower than anticipated, and total Tesla sales for the first three months of the year missed expectations, despite a 45 percent jump in Model S electric car sales.Sales are one of the most important metrics for the unprofitable, cash-bleeding company. By most estimates the last half of the year will require Tesla\xa0to deliver an average of about 24,300 Model S and Model X vehicles in each of the last two quarters in order to reach its minimum target of 80,000 unit deliveries, up from a little over 50,000 vehicles last year. The company delivered a record 17,500 units in the last three months of 2015, so Tesla will need to significantly step up its production game moving forward.Co-founder and CEO Elon Musk can expect to be asked during the company’s post-earnings conference call with analysts (which can be heard here after markets close in New York on Thursday) about a damning Consumer Reports article citing numerous quality issues with the Model X, most notably with the vehicle’s complicated articulated, two-joint “falcon wing” doors. Tesla has downplayed the problems, which include doors that don’t open or close properly, and so far most customers and investors are giving the company the benefit of the doubt. For the early adopters, these “beta” versions of the Model X required a trip\xa0to a company service center for repairs.Wait, what? pic.twitter.com/PvNlJ6A44A&mdash; Charley Grant (@CGrantWSJ) April 27, 2016“Many Model X issues are resolved (but still working through some) based on discussions with dozens of customers,” Baird Equity Research analyst\xa0Ben Kallo said in a note on Friday in which he reiterated his “outperform” rating on Tesla’s stock with a one-year target price of $300 per share, substantially above Monday’s closing price of $241.80.A Thomson Reuters poll of 19 equity analysts last week showed eight with buy\xa0recommendations,\xa0while six advised investors to sell\xa0and five advised current investors to hold the stock. The number of sell recommendations for Tesla has grown\xa0steadily over the past 12 months, largely due to\xa0concern over how much further the stock price can grow under current company and market conditions.Tesla’s $31.47 billion current market value is more than half the value of Ford or BMW, but the company has only reported one profitable quarter based on Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Based on adjusted, or non-GAAP profit, the company has reported seven quarterly gains. Both accounting methods show Tesla’s losses have mounted every quarter since the end of 2014.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect the Palo Alto, California, electric car company to report for the three months ended March 31 a narrower year-over-year loss of $65.1 million, or 86 cents per share, compared to a loss of $154.2 million, or $1.22 per share, in the same period last year. Revenue is seen growing to $1.60 billion from $1.10 billion in the year-ago period.So far, Tesla has spent about $4 billion to fulfill Musk’s dream of a world filled with battery-powered cars, according to research firm Sanford C. Bernstein. The company was sitting on about $1.2 billion in cash at the end of last year after spending about $1.6 billion in 2015.Tesla collected nearly 400,000 preorders in the first three weeks following the March 31 unveiling of a working Model 3 prototype. Musk will almost certainly provide an update on the number of preorders for the car. At $1,000 a (refundable) pop, the company collected around $400 million in Model 3 down payments last month.This cash provides a much-needed cushion for Tesla, buying it more time before it needs to raise more capital for its massive expansion plans, including its multi-billion-dollar lithium-ion battery\xa0“gigafactory” in Nevada. The factory becomes a higher priority now that Tesla is on the hook for hundreds of thousands more cars that it needs to build.Tesla’s goal is to sell 500,000 cars annually by 2020.""]"

Solar stocks have dipped since then\xa0as the clean energy giant’s misfortunes cast a shadow over the industry.Yet analysts say the outlook for other companies in the sector\xa0remains relatively bright as solar projects keep booming.\xa0U.S. solar installations are on track to grow by 16,000 megawatts this year — a leap of 120 percent\xa0over 2015 installations, GTM Research forecast. Worldwide, new solar projects will total 68,000 megawatts this year, nearly a quarter more than last year’s additions, Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF) estimated.“It’s quite an exciting year,” Jenny Chase, BNEF’s head of solar analysis, said from Switzerland. Demand for solar projects is rising as technology and installation costs continue to plummet. In the U.S., the recent extension of a key federal tax credit for solar developers will also help drive more projects for the next five years, Chase said.    The U.S. solar market is set to grow a staggering 119 percent this year compared to 2015 installations. Photo: GTM Research / SEIA U.S. Solar Market Insight  Solar developers still face continuous headwinds. Natural gas in particular is still cheaper on average per megawatt-hour than solar power, although the gap is narrowing globally.\xa0In U.S. states such as Arizona and Nevada, efforts by utility companies and regulators to curtail subsidies for solar customers could make it more expensive\xa0for some homeowners or businesses to adopt solar technology.But the downfall of Missouri-based SunEdison was largely the result of an overly ambitious acquisition spree and chaotic business strategy rather than a reflection of the fortunes of the entire sector, analysts say. The company became the world’s largest solar and wind developer as it struck dozens of deals and amassed over $10 billion in debt. That approach left the firm with too little cash and a host of legal and regulatory problems.“SunEdison’s bankruptcy says more about the company’s strategic decisions than about the solar industry as a whole,” Chase said.U.S. solar companies reporting first-quarter earnings this week or next include First Solar Inc. (NASDAQ:FSLR),\xa0SunPower Corp. (NASDAQ:SPWR)\xa0and SolarCity Corp. (NASDAQ:SCTY).First Solar Inc.First Solar makes thin-film solar panels from cadmium and telluride (most other panels use polysilicon)\xa0and builds and sells solar projects. The company is scheduled to report first-quarter earnings Wednesday after the closing bell.The Tempe, Arizona-based company is expected to report earnings of 88 cents per share for the quarter, up from a loss of 62 cents in the first\xa0quarter of 2015, according to analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. Non-GAAP earnings are expected to reach 88 cents from a loss of 55 cents.\xa0Net income could rise to $95 million from a loss of $55.6 million last year.Revenue for the quarter could total $952.2 million, up from nearly $470 million in the first three months of 2015, according to the poll.Analysts at Morningstar Inc., an independent investment research firm, said they are bullish on First Solar, whose thin-film panel technology is increasingly competitive\xa0with lower-cost Chinese polysilicon panels.“We are becoming increasingly confident that First Solar truly has the brightest future of any company in the sector,” the analysts wrote in a research note provided by email. “Its technology road map and cost-reduction plans are enough to ensure that the company will remain solidly profitable beyond the next couple years.”SunPower Corp.The Silicon Valley company manufactures solar panel\xa0and installation technologies and develops projects at the residential, commercial and utility scale.Chase said that because SunPower and rival First Solar develop and sell large projects throughout the year, their results tend to be “lumpy” from one quarter to the next.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters said they expect 31-year-old SunPower to report a wider loss of 42 cents per share for the three months ended\xa0March 31\xa0from a loss of 7 cents for the same period in 2015. Non-GAAP losses are expected to reach 14 cents per share for the quarter, down from earnings of 13 cents per share last year.\xa0Net income is expected to decline by $11 million for the first three months of 2016 compared with income of\xa0nearly $20 million last year.The analysts expect\xa0first-quarter revenue to total $328.2 million, a less than 10 percent dip from revenue of $360.6 million in the same period last year.SunPower said in February it expects non-GAAP revenue in 2016 between $3.2 billion and $3.4 billion, up from full-year non-GAAP revenue of $2.6 billion. Total solar project deployments are expected to rise between 1,700 megawatts and\xa02,000 megawatts, up from last year’s 1,150 megawatts.SunPower is expected to report first-quarter earnings May 5, although the company has not yet confirmed that date.\xa0SolarCity Corp.SolarCity, whose largest investor is Tesla Motors Inc. founder Elon Musk, has seen its stock quiver in recent months after the company said it was dialing back an aggressive expansion strategy. The Silicon Valley company primarily develops rooftop solar installations on homes and office buildings.SolarCity is expected to\xa0report a loss of $1.78 per share compared with\xa0a loss of 22 cents in the same period last year, analysts polled by Thomson Reuters said. Adjusted for one-time events, losses are expected to plunge to $2.34 a share\xa0compared with an adjusted loss of $1.52 in the first quarter of 2015.SolarCity’s stock in February plunged by over 30 percent after the company forecast a bigger-than-expected loss for the first quarter as installations fell below its target. SolarCity deployed 272 megawatts in the fourth quarter of 2015, below its forecast of 280 to 300 megawatts.CEO Lyndon Rive\xa0surprised investors last fall by announcing the company would slow installation growth as it seeks to reduce costs and become cash-flow positive. SolarCity has installed more than 1,000 megawatts of solar panels since its 2006 launch, an expansion driven largely by its expensive\xa0marketing campaign to entice homeowners to slap panels on their rooftops.Andrew Bischof, an equity analyst at Morningstar in Chicago, said he would be watching closely to see if SolarCity can meet its revised goals for new installations and cost reductions this year.\xa0“I don’t think the switch in strategy is necessarily a bad thing,” he said. “But I think management needs to be able to deliver on these new targets that they set out for themselves.”The Thomson Reuters poll found that analysts expected first-quarter revenue of\xa0$108.5 million, up slightly from $102.8 million in the year-earlier\xa0period. But income losses were seen falling to $241.5 million, down from a loss of $155.7 million in the first quarter of 2015.Chase, the BNEF analyst, said the wide mismatch between SolarCity’s revenue and reported income reflect the company’s heavy spending on marketing — including television and billboard advertisements and door-to-door campaigns — to attract new customers, although the company is vowing to curb these expenses. “The more revenue it makes, the more negative its net income is,” she explained.The company is expected to\xa0report first quarter earnings on May 3,\xa0although the company has not yet confirmed that date.']"

We consider the car a smart mobile device on four wheels, essentially no different to a cellphone or tablet\xa0.”Talking about Apple, Jia told CNBC:\xa0“We believe the next generation of mobile internet will be more open, more ecosystem oriented instead of being a closed loop.\xa0Ironically, Apple’s over-dominance, lack of internet-thinking and the closed-off nature of its systems, all hindered innovation in the internet mobile industry.”Like Xiaomi,\xa0another Chinese company making waves on the global market, LeEco sees itself as an internet company first and foremost.\xa0“We think the difference between us and Apple is very large. Apple is a mobile phone company focused on hardware and software,” Jia said. “[LeEco] is focused on the internet first, and only then on software, and finally on hardware.”Since he founded the company\xa0in 2004, Jia has been building what he called “Le Ecosystem” which is\xa0an online platform with content, devices and applications. LeEco is involved in a wide range of industries, including cloud computing, e-commerce, agriculture and video production, in addition to its more high-profile products.The company is seeking to expand beyond its home country in China with its eye on the smartphone markets in the United States and India.']"

The report, which will arrive after markets close that day in New York City, will address progress the company is making on the rollout of its Model X unity vehicle.The recent unveiling\xa0of the lower-priced Model 3 electric compact sedan -- which led to\xa0roughly 400,000 pre-orders at $1,000 apiece this month -- also drew\xa0a much-needed cash influx.\xa0But CEO Elon Musk's company will need to raise more capital, which might be a center of discussion during a live webcast between Tesla’s leadership and analysts at 5:30 p.m. EDT after the results are released.Musk will likely be asked about Monday’s Consumer Reports review citing a number of quality issues with “early build” Model X vehicles. Earlier this month, Tesla said it delivered nearly 15,000 vehicles in the first quarter, with Model S electric sedan sales jumping 45 percent compared to the same period last year.In order to meet its goal of delivering at least 80,000 vehicles this year, Tesla will need to average about 21,700 vehicles per quarter for the rest of the year, so Musk will likely address questions about whether this target can be reached.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect the 13-year-old Silicon Valley electric car maker to report a narrower loss of 86 cents per share for the three months ending March 31, from a loss of $1.22 for the same period last year. Adjusted for Tesla’s non-GAAP accounting, losses are expected to widen to 61 cents per share from 36 cents in the year-ago period.Revenue is expected to grow to $1.61 billion, from $1.10 billion in the same period last year.Investors are less interested in the company’s losses – it’s spending massively to grow its operations – and more interested in revenue growth. Sales targets are also important, most notably how many Model X cars the company is building each week. Analysts are also paying close attention to gross profit margins excluding the revenue the company receives from California carbon emission credits paid by other automakers.""]"

Underscoring the problems that can arise for\xa0early adopters of new products,\xa0the magazine pointed to the vehicle’s biggest engineering challenge: its articulated “falcon wing” doors.Shares in the Palo Alto, California, electric car company (NASDAQ:TSLA)\xa0plunged nearly 5 percent in intra-day trading as investors sold on the report, but the price recovered to end the day about 2.6 percent lower, at\xa0$247.37. The stock\xa0extended losses into after-hours trading.“Consumer Reports recommends against buying a vehicle in its first year of production —\xa0especially a ground-up vehicle with the incredible complexity of a Tesla,” the widely read product reviewer said Tuesday.The most notable problem\xa0has been the rear passenger door, which has\xa0posed considerable challenges and led to a lawsuit in January against a German supplier for allegedly misrepresenting its engineering claims.Consumer Reports cites two significant problems with “early build” Model X vehicles: “falcon wing” doors that either failed to close or bumped into obstacles they should have detected, causing slight damage, and visual distortion at night from the long, curved windshield that causes the driver to experience\xa0“double vision” of headlights, taillights and street lamps. \xa0A Tesla owner also reported that the AutoPilot hands-free driving feature became “confused” when a road’s shoulder ended, requiring the driver to take command. (Semi-autonomous driving features relies partly on clear road line markings to maintain lane discipline.)Tesla CEO Elon Musk had said in the past that the “falcon wing” door design was a primary cause of previous delays to the introduction of the vehicle, originally scheduled for early 2014. The company began delivering the car to customers in September 2015.Tesla issued a statement saying the defects in “early Model X builds” are not “widespread.”Consumer Reports has given the Tesla Model S luxury electric sedan high praise for performance and innovation, but lower-than-average marks for reliability. In 2014, reviewers cited problems with the Model S, but nearly all of them said the company was responsive to quickly fixing the problems.Earlier this month Tesla\xa0unveiled a working prototype of the Model 3 electric compact sedan with a starting price of $35,000 before add-ons. The company has received about 400,000 pre-orders for the car, which won’t begin deliveries until the end of 2017.Ryan Brinkman, a J.P. Morgan automotive equities analyst, said Tesla could face considerable challenges to delivering all 400,000 of these vehicles by the end of 2019, much less build and sell that many in a single year. By 2020, Tesla says it’s aiming to sell 500,000 cars annually, mostly from Model 3 orders.“I’m not sure you can take that 400,000 number and say they can do that in 2020,” he said Tuesday during a conference call. “I still think there are a lot of reasons to be skeptical about Tesla.”Tesla has sold about 126,000 cars since it\xa0was founded in 2003, including a small number of the discontinued Roadster built from 2008 to 2012.']"

It is the first recall for the Model X since Tesla began deliveries of the luxury electric SUV in September.The electric carmaker said it was recalling the vehicles after the seats failed a strength test in the European Union. Tesla had previously performed 15 tests in the United States, and those seats\xa0passed. The EU test was more stringent, the company said.The company will begin notifying customers Monday. The repair, which will replace both third-row seats, will take about two hours. The process to fix all recalled cars will take about five weeks, Jon McNeil, Tesla\'s president of sales and service, told reporters on a conference call.""We\'ve had no issues with any failures in the field,"" he said.Tesla said that supplier Futuris had manufactured the seats and would assume all costs for their replacement.']"

The figure fell short of the expected 16,000 units. The company blamed the miss on a shortage of parts for the Model X utility vehicle that went on sale in November.“The root causes of the parts shortages were: Tesla’s hubris in adding far too much new technology to the Model X in [the highest performance] version 1, insufficient supplier capability validation, and Tesla not having broad enough internal capability to manufacture the parts in-house,” the company said in a statement Monday.Tesla sold 2,400 Model X vehicles in the first three months of the year, well above the 208 SUVs it sold by\xa0the end of 2015. Tesla says the lower-than-expected figure will not hinder meeting\xa0its goal of delivering 80,000 to\xa090,000 vehicles this year.

The stock closed Monday at $246.99, its highest level since Oct. 2.Tesla’s sales trajectory is an important benchmark for the 13-year-old Silicon Valley maker of the Model S electric sedan and Model X utility vehicle. The cash-bleeding automaker wants to boost\xa0annual sales tenfold, to 500,000 cars, by 2020, a formidable pace of growth\xa0even for an established car company.But on Thursday the company unveiled its $35,000 Model 3 mid-sized sedan to much fanfare and garnered more than 276,000 pre-orders as of Saturday evening. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has said deliveries to early customers will begin at the end of 2017.Customers have been flocking to Tesla’s website to make $1,000 refundable deposits on the Model 3, giving the company more than $250 million in much-needed capital in less than three days.

Assuming no cancellations or refunds, the value of the pre-orders tops $11.6\xa0billion as of Saturday.\xa0“Despite its many worthy accomplishments,\xa0Tesla\xa0had not yet truly disrupted the auto industry.

But to do that it will need to average 20,000 cars each quarter.

The launch was also broadcast live online to millions around the world.Complete with Tesla\'s\xa0Autopilot feature,\xa0Musk said the car can seat five people comfortably, and the interiors look\xa0spacious enough from the images as seen on the live feed. The dashboard looks right out of a science fiction movie, with a large horizontally aligned touchscreen —\xa0and little else.\xa0    A view of the dash controls and interiors of the Tesla Model 3 at its launch event in Hawthorne, California, March 31, 2016. Photo: Tesla Motors  Even before anyone outside of Tesla’s inner circle had seen the vehicle, thousands of Tesla loyalists queued up at dealerships as much as 48 hours before the event to plop down $1,000 pre-payments for a car that won’t be ready for them until the end of 2017 for the earliest buyers. Online orders began as the event kicked off to a small crowd at the Southern California campus of Musk’s satellite transport company, SpaceX.And before the day was officially over, Tesla had already received 115,000 orders for the car, Musk told the gathered crowd.\xa0The Model 3 is available in red, silver and black.Originally code-named “Bluestar,” the scaled down car has always been part of Tesla’s objective, going back to the company’s original business plan in 2007. Six years later at the Detroit Auto Show, Tesla design chief Franz von Holzhausen compared the vehicle to the Audi A4, BMW 3-Series and the Volkswagen Jetta, though he estimated a starting price of $30,000 at the time.Musk has said repeatedly over the years that his luxury wheels — the Roadster sports car, the Model S sedan and, most recently, the Model X utility vehicle — were built to heighten interest in electric vehicles.By selling innovative fancy cars to the rich, Tesla\xa0has managed to stir enough interest to keep itself flush with much-needed cash. But the Model 3 is Tesla’s big test, a make-or-break vehicle for the 13-year-old Silicon Valley automaker. Tesla has been selling its other cars at a loss, and has been depleting its cash while piling on debt.Meanwhile, the Model 3 will end up being not the first but the second sub-$40,000 electric car to have a range topping 200 miles. General Motors will begin selling its Chevrolet Bolt later this year for around $37,500 before U.S. federal and state incentives.Both cars are eligible for the $7,500 U.S. green-car tax credit, but manufacturers are limited to the first 200,000 eligible cars they sell. Tesla has already used a good chunk of this quota. The company has sold about 126,000 cars since the first Roadster was delivered in 2008, according to its regulatory filings dating back to 2011. It’s not clear how many of these customers received the incentive.']"

In the early days, Musk touted the possibly of an electric car costing less than $30,000, but the final product is ringing in at a higher base price. Still, it’s in the price range of what someone shopping for a gas-drinking\xa0BMW 3-Series or Audi A4 would consider.While we don’t know much about the car, a few unconfirmed details from the auto blogs suggest a base range of more than 200 miles per charge with a battery upgrade that adds 100 miles and about $20,000 to the price.

That’s when the company will show to the world the first working prototype of the Model 3. Production of Tesla’s most important model —which is priced lower than a high-end Toyota Camry after U.S. federal tax incentives — isn’t scheduled until late 2017. Most customers can expect their cars well into 2018, especially if they live abroad.Production constraints have vexed Tesla ever since the 2013 release of the Model S. U.S. customers were left waiting longer for the luxury electric sedan when Tesla began staggering deliveries to Europe and Asia. Production of the Model X was delayed numerous times, in part because of the technical challenges to the vehicle’s articulated “falcon wing” doors.While it’s safe to assume the company has learned from past mistakes and worked out kinks to its supply and production chain, Tesla could still face industrial-startup birthing pains as it juggles three automotive production lines from one factory, something even major automakers with dozens of plants worldwide have grappled with on a much larger scale.Tesla offered special advice for\xa0anyone who really, really wants that Model 3 ASAP.“As a thank\xa0you to our current owners, existing customers will get priority in each region, meaning that the fastest way to buy a Model\xa03 is to buy a Model\xa0S or Model\xa0X,” the company said.

(NASDAQ:TSLA) shares rose nearly 3 percent Monday after investment adviser Argus boosted its ratings to “buy” from “hold” and set a 12-month stock price target of $333, which would put the company’s share price solidly into record-high territory. Most analysts still have a “hold” or lower rating for Tesla’s stock, citing slower-than-expected Model X production.

The proposal was crafted with input from General Motors, pitting one of the world’s oldest and biggest automotive stalwarts against a spritely money-losing startup.If the bill passes, Tesla would lose its Indiana dealership license in January 2018, 30 months after the company acquired the license. Tesla has recruited one of its most valuable assets to fight the bill: its customers and fans. It’s asking them to contact their state representatives to urge them to vote against the measure if it comes up for a vote before the end of the current legislative session on March 14.“Despite contributing over $42 million to the state through the purchase of parts and components from Indiana suppliers; and despite plans underway to construct a 26,000-square- foot Tesla Service facility that will employ approximately a dozen Indiana residents and serve our customers, GM is pushing the Senate Committee to shut out Tesla,” the letter reads.The effort comes months ahead of GM’s introduction of its all-electric Chevrolet Bolt crossover SUV later this year, which\xa0it would sell through its thousands of franchised dealerships.The Bolt is the first fully electric mass-production vehicle, boasting\xa0a range of more than 200 miles per charge. The $30,000 Bolt has the second-longest range of existing electric cars, behind the Model S, and it could steal customers that would consider the $35,000 Tesla Model 3 due out in early 2018.Tesla is accusing GM of fighting against “free-market principles.” GM replied by accusing Tesla of seeking special treatment.“Tesla’s insistence on special rules could result in multiple manufacturers competing with similarly capable vehicles and similar price points, yet operating under a different set of rules,” GM said in a statement Wednesday. “Tesla could open a franchised dealership with an independent operator in Indiana today.”Tesla is allowed to operate its dealerships in about half of U.S. states, including a showroom in Indiana’s state capital, Indianapolis. The Silicon Valley automaker co-founded by business magnate Elon Musk and electric car engineer J.B. Straubel operates what it calls “galleries” in states where sales and service activity is banned.Many state laws, typically crafted with help of larger dealers, prohibit all automakers from setting up retail outlets and offering test drives. In those states, Tesla must deliver its cars on a per-sale basis rather than allowing customers to drive their purchases off the lot.“I call this the ‘Kill Tesla’\xa0bill,” Indiana’s Republican state Rep.

Tesla has sold about 107,000 electric cars since 2012 and in September began trickling out a small number of Model X family utility vehicles. Most of these cars are Model S sedans that have been sold in North America, so the expanded warranty covers most Tesla owners.Tesla said in its recent letter to shareholders that it expects to sell 80,000 to 90,000 vehicles \xa0this year, though some independent analysts estimate the company would deliver fewer vehicles as it ramps up the Model X production at a slower-than-expected pace.On Tuesday, a Consumer Reports magazine automotive tester said Tesla is “having reliability issues.” The widely influential magazine said in 2014 and 2015 that the Model S was the best overall vehicle on the market, but later cited a few reliability problems, including ones covered by the company’s four-year, 50,000-mile warranty.']"

But investors cheered news that the Palo Alto, California, maker of luxury electric cars\xa0confirmed a March 31 unveiling of its $35,000 Model 3 and said it expects to be profitable by the fourth quarter of 2016.In its letter to shareholders released after markets closed in New York City, the\xa0maker of the Model S luxury sedan and Model X sport utility vehicle said it will be producing 1,000 Model X vehicles a week in its second quarter ending in June. Tesa also\xa0said it generated $179 million in positive cash flow at the end of 2015,\xa0a key milestone that shows Tesla gradually weaning itself off external financing.\xa0Tesla also said\xa0it plans to spend $1.5 billion in investments this year, “without accessing any outside capital other than our sources that support our leasing and finished goods inventory.”“During Q4, we reduced Model S production costs, started volume Model X production and still produced a record 14,037 new Tesla vehicles,” said the letter from CEO and Chairman Elon Musk and the company’s new Chief Financial Officer Jason Wheeler.\xa0During a conference call after the earnings were released, Wheeler said the company would\xa0average 700 to 800 cars a week in the second\xa0quarter and would hit 1,600 to 1,800 by the end of the year.\xa0\xa0Tesla reported a net loss on $320.4 million, or $2.44 per share, in the fourth quarter ended December, wider than the loss of $107.6 million and\xa086 cents per share in the same period in 2014. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters prior to the earnings report expected the company to eke out a slight gain of $3.9 million and a loss of 1 cent per share.Investors shrugged at the earnings miss and sent the stock up more than 12 percent in after-hours trading.“The initial response despite the miss is related to some relief that it wasn’t worse with the stock down 40 percent year to date,” said Efraim Levy, senior equity analyst at S&P Global Market Intelligence.Tesla’s revenue rose to $1.21 million. Tesla also reports an alternative adjusted revenue figure based on money backed by the future sale of some post-lease vehicles under a buyback guarantee program. That revenue came in at $1.75 billion, lower than the forecast of $1.8 billion.For the year, Tesla reported a net loss of $888.7 million, or $6.93 per share, wider than the loss of $294 million and $2.36 per share in 2014. Last year’s revenue came in at $4 billion, up from $3.2 billion in the previous year. The company sold about 50,000 cars last year.The company said it’s on track to unveil the Model 3 prototype at the end of March as it begins taking preorders. This will be the public’s first glimpse of the widely\xa0anticipated, low-priced Tesla electric car for mass consumption.']"

But for companies that do most of their business at home in the United States, the end of 2015 was\xa0more generous to their bottom lines.Consider it the home field advantage.As of Thursday, the country’s largest companies had reported an average 5 percent drop in year-over-year profits, led by an ominous 74 percent plunge in energy-related companies. Meanwhile, makers of construction materials, chemicals and shipping containers had seen earnings drop by nearly a fifth.Nearly every big American company has pointed to the same factors: a strong U.S. dollar and\xa0plunging oil prices. Weakness in China’s economy also has rippled through emerging markets and sent the price of everything from wheat to iron ore plunging.“There’s not a lot of surprise in the areas of that have been disappointing. Expectations were low for energy and materials,” said\xa0Eric Wiegand, senior portfolio manager at U.S. Bank Wealth Management. “The companies are\xa0commenting on the same themes: a strong dollar, low commodity prices, concerns over global demand.\xa0The strong dollar is a big issue. Large multinationals are talking about mid-\xa0to\xa0high-single-digit impacts on their revenue.”For example, Procter & Gamble\xa0Chief Financial Officer Jon Moeller said in his company’s fiscal-second-quarter conference call last month that the dollar’s strength led to a $1.5 billion loss in after-tax profit in P&G’s previous fiscal year.This means companies that sell their goods and services in the U.S. are faring better than the ones with a lot of their sales generated overseas. This U.S.-centricity has become a major theme for the fourth quarter of 2015.Four of the 10 sectors that reported year-over-year earnings growth in the last quarter are heavily reliant on the U.S. economy rather than global economic activity. This includes biotech and medical device manufactures, as well as producers of consumer discretionary goods, including auto parts, leisure products and retailers that order goods made abroad.Delivering financial reports in the coming week are major media companies Walt Disney, Twenty-First Century Fox and Time Warner. Soda giants Coca-Cola and PepsiCo will also provide the latest updates on their activities.Below is a rundown of reports expected next week from\xa0select companies for the 2015 calendar year’s fourth quarter, with estimates provided by analysts polled by Thomson Reuters and stock price movements based on market closing levels Thursday.MONDAYHasbro\xa0Inc.

The so-called summon feature gives a user an exciting glimpse into how driverless cars may work in the future.Version 3.0 of the Remote S for Tesla app for the Apple Watch developed by Rego Apps launched its use of the feature Wednesday. When activated, it starts the car and brings it out toward the road. Ordinarily, the vehicle requires the keyfob to be nearby when starting, but if a user enables the “Remote/Keyless Start” option, the car can be summoned by the user’s Apple Watch without the keyfob being in the vicinity.One YouTube user, Mark Schey, recorded a video of himself summoning his Tesla Model S P85D and uploaded it Thursday. In the comments, Rego Apps showed up to congratulate Schey on summoning his car, revealing that the developer did not actually have the Apple Watch to hand when coding the feature and had not had a chance to try it out.The summon feature was enabled in Tesla Motors Inc.’s version 7.1 software update that launched Jan. 10 and works with the Model S and Model X. The company bills it as a way of having a car ready to go during the morning routine, eliminating the need to squeeze it out of the garage.Tesla sees this early version of the summon feature as a step toward having users’ cars meet them anywhere across the country, charging themselves along the way. Paired with Remote S, it’s possible that future versions of the\xa0feature would allow users to command their vehicles from their wrists while doing so.Remote S for Tesla is priced at $9.99 at the U.S. iTunes Store and works on the\xa0Apple Watch, iPad and iPhone.']"

Those automakers range from German premium brands such as\xa0Mercedes-Benz, Porsche and Audi, to makers of lower-cost EVs, such as\xa0the 2017 Chevrolet Bolt and the 2018 Nissan Leaf, which are both expected to boast ranges of up to 200 miles per charge, well above the 80 to 90 miles current mass-produced EVs are providing.With so much activity and interest from the major\xa0automakers, Tesla doesn’t have a lot of wiggle room for flubs or delays in its production and expansion schedules. The company has faced immense pressure from Wall Street to meet benchmarks and deadlines.When the Palo Alto, California,\xa0automaker reports its fourth-quarter and full-year earnings results next week, Tesla-watchers should look for progress on Model X production and delivery pace to customers, many of whom made down payments years ago on the $80,000 seven-seater.Also, Tesla should provide an important update on progress in the lower-priced sub-$40,000 Model 3 electric sedan, a crucial component to the company’s long-range plan to sell 500,000 cars a year by 2020, up tenfold from the current level. The world is expected to catch a first glimpse of the Model 3 in March, when pre-orders are expected to begin, but some think the unexpected slower pace of Model X deliveries could delay the release of the Model 3.“Manufacturing and engineering challenges have delayed the [Model X] launch by at least one\xa0year and may have added hundreds of millions of dollars to costs while potentially losing some customers,” Adam Jonas, automotive analyst for Morgan Stanley, wrote in a research note Monday. “It is reasonable to assume that Tesla's technical resources have been diverted from other projects to ensure proper execution on X.”Morgan Stanley currently expects Model X production challenges to delay the Model 3 by a year beyond Tesla’s own forecast, into late 2018. These are the kinds of delays that could adversely impact Tesla’s share price, which has lost 30 percent of its value since customers began receiving the Model X at a slower-than-expected pace.Tesla Motors Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) will report fourth-quarter and full-year results after markets close Feb. 10. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect the automaker\xa0to post a loss of $2.2 million and a gain of 2 cents per share, up from a losses of $107.6 million and 86 cents per share. Adjusted net income is expected to be $24.2 million, or 10 cents per share, up from a loss\xa0of $16.2 million or 13 cents per share. Revenue is expected to grow to $1.8\xa0billion from $1.1 billion in the last three months of 2014.One of the most important metrics for Tesla — besides sales and production numbers and gross profit margins — is its revenue growth. Much like another famous growth stock, Amazon.com, as long as the Tesla can keep reporting satisfactory revenue growth figures every quarter, and keep enough cash on hand, investors will ignore lack of profitability.But Tesla’s widely tracked revenue figures come with a footnote.Like many companies, Tesla engages in some accounting practices that don’t conform to generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. For example, it removes expenses related to stock-based compensation to its executives, a practice that’s become a sore issue among some accountants who say employee stock options should be counted as expenses.Less common is for companies to report adjustments to revenue. Tesla uses two measures for its revenue, one required by GAAP rules and another that it prefers to use based on income from its leased vehicles, which come with a buyback guarantee. And through a relationship with US Bank and Wells Fargo, Tesla is booking the full value of its lease revenue, rather than the preferred GAAP measure of booking income from leased cars as payments are made. Some of Tesla’s revenue is based on the future resale value of post-lease cars.Since most Tesla cars are leased, the difference between how Tesla reports lease revenue and how GAAP requires it is broad, and widening. In the third quarter the difference between GAAP and non-GAAP revenue was about $300 million, or 24 percent of the $1.24 billion in revenue Tesla reported in the three-months ending October.""]"
https://www.ibtimes.com/what-apple-inc-can-buy-its-216-billion-cash-pile-offset-stalled-iphone-sales-2290735,What Apple Inc. Can Buy With Its $216 Billion Cash Pile To Offset Stalled iPhone Sales,Luke Villapaz,02/02/16,3:26 PM,"['With $216 billion in cash on hand, Apple can\xa0butt its way into any number of businesses\xa0without blinking an eye. And this may be the right time for it to make some strategic investments.Apple\'s\xa0iPhone sales are lagging, and in the quarter ending March\xa026, the company is expected to post its first year-over-year smartphone sales decline. While the iPhone continues to provide the bulk of Apple’s revenue, investors are looking to the company to find ways to boost\xa0its revenue again and diversify. Here are a few conceivable purchases that might\xa0help it get back to growth:Netflix ($39.85 billion Market Capitalization)With a streaming music service in its pocket, the only thing Apple is missing on the content side is video. It tried to do that with a live television streaming service of its own, but that has yet to materialize due to stalls in negotiations between the company and content owners, according to Bloomberg.One possible alternative for Apple would be the outright purchase of Netflix. Rumors to that effect hit the internet this week.\xa0Netflix\' stable of original content is on the rise, and so is its subscriber base, which tacked on 5.7 million additional U.S. users and 3.49 million international members for a total just shy of 75 million total subscribers in 2015. One potential drawback is that while Apple would gain access to Netflix’s growing stable of original content, it would still lack deals for content from the major networks.Odds: Depends if Apple can convince Netflix that it really just wants to literally just ""Netflix and chill"" and not the term\'s other meaning.HuluAlternatively Apple could instead take aim at Hulu and spend a fraction of what it would cost to gain a controlling stake\xa0in Netflix or an outright purchase of the company. Time Warner is eyeing a 25 percent stake in the joint venture owned by NBCUniversal, Fox Broadcasting Co.\xa0and Disney, according to the Wall Street Journal. But that could come at the cost of removing current episodes of shows on the service.Were Apple to pursue a stake in Hulu instead, it could give Apple a cheaper way into a streaming content service for the Apple TV —\xa0an area where\xa0Apple has\xa0gained little\xa0traction. Time Warner’s potential stake in Hulu would value the service at about $5 billion to $6 billion, according to a November estimate from the Wall Street Journal. That\'s\xa0a fraction of the potential cost for a Netflix purchase. It would also be more in line with Apple’s acquisitions to date, the most of expensive of which was the $3 billion purchase of Beats Electronics and Beats Music in 2014.Odds: Likely one of Apple\'s cheapest ways into streaming video.Tesla Motors\xa0($25.85 billion Market Capitalization)If Apple wants to get its electric car project off the ground faster, it could \xa0purchase\xa0a company that already has an established brand in the market — namely Tesla Motors. By\xa0acquiring the company founded by Elon Musk, Apple would gain access to extensive electric vehicle manufacturing capacity and knowledge,\xa0as well as its advanced battery technology and factory in Sparks, Nevada.Apple has work cut out for it if the\xa0Project Titan electric car will hit a target ship date of\xa02019. In January it was revealed that project lead executive Steve Zadesky is expected to leave the company. That news was shortly followed by talk that Apple implemented a hiring freeze on the team because Apple Chief Design Officer Jony Ive was unhappy with the progress made on the electric vehicle project.Odds: As likely as a SpaceX rocket landing on a floating barge without crashing.Twitter ($11.76 billion Market Capitalization)With Apple’s push into music and a rumored push into video, maybe social media could be in the cards. At just under a $12 billion market cap, Apple could pick up the Twitter network and its more than\xa0300 million monthly active users with plenty of money left over.That said, Twitter is probably far down the list of prospective acquisitions for the iPhone maker. In the past Apple hasn’t found much success running\xa0its own social network, namely the iTunes Ping social music network. Apple launched the service alongside a 2010 iTunes update, but it lasted\xa0only two years before the plug was pulled.Odds: Highly unlikely. But if Apple did go ahead with this purchase, journalists would be only a hashtag away from the company.Nvidia ($15.52 billion Market Capitalization)If Apple pushes forward with an autonomous-driving feature for the rumored Apple Car, the acquisition of Nvidia could be one way it gets there. While the company is primarily known for its role in developing and manufacturing graphics cards for workstations and gamers, it also has\xa0shown increased interest in developing artificial-intelligence hardware — such as its Drive PX 2 computer — to perform sensor calculations and computing power for autonomous driving purposes.In addition to autonomous-driving technology, Nvidia has experience developing graphics processors that are powerful enough for handling the requirements of virtual reality headsets, such as Facebook’s Oculus. That knowledge could be helpful for Apple, which is developing virtual reality technology of its own.Odds: Virtually possible, but Apple may instead poach individual talent from the company.Advanced Micro Devices\xa0($1.66 billion Market Capitalization)One particular limitation to Apple’s line of Mac desktops and notebooks is that upgrades to the computer lineup are\xa0heavily dependent on Intel’s calendar of desktop and notebook processor rollouts. By purchasing AMD, Apple would gain the engineering knowledge to build its\xa0own desktop processors and perhaps graphics chips.The drawback to such a purchase is that AMD licenses some key x86 processor architecture patents via a cross-licensing deal with Intel. The license is nontransferable, so in the event of a takeover bid from an outside company, Apple would be required to strike up another deal with Intel before it could start making x86 processors, according to documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.Odds: \xa0Apple in 2008 bought a chip designer to aid its mobile chip efforts, so it could\xa0happen\xa0again.    With an anticipated decline in iPhone sales, Apple is looking for new ways to generate revenue growth. Photo: Chance Chan/Reuters  ']"

In addition, Tesla's management is expected to hold a live question-and-answer webcast that afternoon to discuss the company’s financial and business results and outlook. \xa0The company recently filed a federal lawsuit against German auto parts maker Hoerbiger Automotive Comfort Systems LLC, alleging that the company misrepresented its ability to design the flashy “falcon wing” doors on Tesla's Model X vehicle, resulting in a last-minute change to a new supplier that caused delays, the Wall Street Journal previously reported. The lawsuit aims to stop Hoerbriger from demanding more payment from Tesla after it cut ties with the German supplier in May 2015, requesting the court to state that Tesla did not breach any contracts and to pay damages and attorney fees.\xa0“We were forced to file this lawsuit after Hoerbiger decided to ignore their contracts with us and instead demanded a large sum of money to which they are not entitled,” a Tesla spokeswoman said in an email, the Wall Street Journal reported. “We will vigorously prosecute this case.”\xa0The lawsuit alleges that prototypes from Hoerbiger leaked oil and sagged or produced excessive heat, causing them to stop working. Hoerbiger is seeking additional payments from Tesla for work it claims it was promised.The release of Model X has been delayed on numerous occasions. It was originally slated to be produced in early 2013, but was pushed back to late 2015, aside from a handful of vehicles that went to company executives and early investors. Earlier this month, Tesla detailed its fourth-quarter deliveries, which included barely over 200 Model X cars, MarketWatch reported.“Model X deliveries are in line with the very early stages of our Model X production ramp as we prioritize quality above all else,” the spokeswoman said, the Wall Street Journal reported. “That ramp has been increasing exponentially, with the daily production rate in the last week of the year tracking to production of 238 Model X vehicles per week.”""]"

But reports have at least pointed to the project. In May, Apple was scouting for locations to test vehicles, according to the Guardian. In September, the company gave the heads of its “Project Titan” permission to triple the staff, up from the 600 people originally working on the program, according to the  Wall Street Journal.Apple in December also registered several car-related web domains, fueling the speculation around its project, according to  MacRumors.Despite Apple’s\xa0accelerated push into developing an Apple Car, Musk welcomed the entrance of additional players into the electric car market. ""Tesla will still aspire to make the most compelling electric vehicles, and that would be our goal, while at the same time helping other companies to make electric cars as well,” he told the BBC on Monday.But while his words were kind in his latest interview, Musk in the past has poked fun at Apple as the place where Tesla engineers go if they couldn’t make the cut. ""They have hired people we’ve fired,” Musk said in an interview with German newspaper  Handelsblatt in October. “We always jokingly call Apple the ‘Tesla Graveyard’. If you don’t make it at Tesla, you go work at  Apple . I’m not kidding.”Apple’s car isn’t expected until 2019 at the earliest, but in the meantime Tesla has made strides with its electric vehicles by introducing new features such as a self-driving mode and, most recently, the ability for a\xa0Tesla vehicle to self-park and pull out of the garage at its owner’s command via a feature called  Summon.']"
https://www.ibtimes.com/tesla-curbs-autopilot-functionality-model-s-cars-2258346,Tesla Curbs Autopilot Functionality In Model S Cars,Reuters,01/10/16,3:02 PM,"['Tesla Motors Inc. said Sunday it was updating the Autopilot driving systems in Model S sedans to put new limits on its hands-free operation, which has been both praised for its innovation and criticized for having been launched too early. The function will now be restricted on residential roads or roads without a center divider, Tesla said, meaning that the car cannot drive faster than a maximum of the speed limit plus 5 mph.When Autopilot launched in October, CEO Elon Musk cautioned that the hotly anticipated function was in beta mode, or a test phase of development, with full “hands-off” driving not recommended. Still, a host of subsequent videos posted by Tesla drivers on YouTube showed near-misses on the road with Autopilot, prompting Musk to say he would curb the function to minimize the possibility of people doing “crazy things.”Tesla, the U.S. pioneer in luxury electric cars charged by batteries, was one of the first companies to offer a steering system that could be operated hands-free, one of the first steps to full self-driving that industry experts believe may be available by 2020. The car is able to keep to its lane using cameras, radars, GPS and mapping functions, but glitches can sometimes occur when roads are not clearly marked.Tesla’s expertise in software has allowed it to add the hands-free functionality through a software update, but critics have suggested the company should have delayed the Autopilot launch until it was perfect.At CES in Las Vegas last week, the head of General Motors Co.’s global product development, Mark Reuss, said his company would “never” use over-the-air upgrades in safety-critical systems such as steering and braking.Besides curtailing functionality on residential roads, improvements have been made to help the car better stay in lanes even with faded lane markings and when passing exits.In cruise-control mode, the car will now anticipate highway exits by slowing down if you have activated your turn signal, Tesla said. The company also said a Model S driver could now park their car from outside the vehicle in tight spots such as narrow garages. The car can also park itself in spots perpendicular to the curb.']"

Thanks to what CEO Elon Musk described as “people doing crazy things” with Autosteer, the company is scaling back its functionality.Tesla will restrict the technology to speeds below 45 mph on single-lane roads with clearly delineated line markings. The beta version of the latest 7.1 Tesla firmware update that’s going to Tesla customers worldwide also includes a series of other changes, including an updated user interface and self-parking.Tesla’s Autosteer function is closely watched because it’s seen as a sign of things to come. More cars are including sensor-based driver-assistance features that skirt the boundary of convenience and auto safety. Tesla currently offers a package of driver’s assistance features that it calls Autopilot, which includes Autosteer, Auto Lane Change (initiated when the driver activates a turn signal), 360-degree Side-Collison Warning, and an enhanced version of Autopark that allows the vehicle to park itself without an occupant.While the company has specifically warned that the “convenience” of Autosteer requires drivers to keep their hands on the wheel, the internet is filled with videos showing excited Tesla owners ignoring the instructions. In one example, a Tesla owner in the Netherlands shows a Tesla car speeding down a highway with nobody in the driver’s seat. (The GIF above, from a YouTube video, shows a Tesla on the road using Autosteer.)So far there have been no reports of accidents using the function, but with so few Tesla cars on roads (roughly 100,000 worldwide, and most of them in the U.S.), the statistical likelihood of accident or injury in Tesla cars is likely very low compared to\xa0high-volume luxury automakers.At least one member of the widely read Tesla Motors Forum claims to have been pulled over and ticketed while using the car’s Autopilot\xa0lane-keeping function: “When the police officer walked up he asked ‘have you been drinking or texting.

China, the world’s largest car market since 2009, is emerging as the top spot for plug-in cars.To give you an idea of how much a combination of aggressive government incentives and crippling urban smog has rapidly transformed the country’s electric-vehicle market, consider this: Chinese consumers have purchased more fully electric cars in the first 10 months of the year -- nearly 114,000 units, according to official industry figures -- than the roughly 100,000 cars Tesla has sold since the company was founded 12 years ago.And after air pollution levels in China’s capital touched “red alert” levels for the first time this week, aspiring new-car owners reportedly flooded local dealerships asking about China’s growing list of modestly priced, domestically made electric vehicles.""I\'m considering [an electric car] as the new policy means electric cars aren\'t limited from driving on heavy pollution days while other types are,""\xa0Wang Chao,\xa0a 26-year-old car shopper in Beijing, told Reuters. Chao was curious about electric cars built by BYD, maker of the e5 electric sedan and e6 electric SUV. In China’s larger cities, gasoline-powered cars are routinely prohibited from circulating on certain days during smog emergencies.A forecast released Sunday by the China Association of Automobile Manufactures (CAAM) predicted\xa0Chinese consumers will buy as many as 250,000 electric and gas-electric plug-in hybrids in 2015, a massive jump from the nearly 75,000 electric and partially electric cars purchased last year from domestic carmakers, including BYD, BAIC, Chery and Changan.The forecast didn’t say how many of these cars would be fully electric, but the latest figures show a massive rise in demand for cars that don\'t use any\xa0gasoline. In the first nine months of the year, the Chinese bought nearly three times more electric cars than in the same period last year, rising from 22,258 to 87,531. The sales are being generated by lucrative manufacturer subsidies, tax and registration-fee breaks and urban driving restrictions imposed on gas-powered cars.Meanwhile, U.S. electric cars sales are decelerating thanks to low fuel prices, which lure\xa0American car shoppers to less fuel-efficient vehicles. U.S. consumers purchased 90,923 electric and gas-electric hybrid plug-ins in the first 10 months of the year, a 7 percent drop from the same period last year, an estimate from the Electric Drive Transportation Association\xa0indicated.While electric car demand is\xa0flying in China, it\'s worth noting these zero-emission (or partially zero-emission) vehicles make up a sliver of the total market.

It comes after the discovery of\xa0an improperly anchored front seat belt in one Model S in Europe, which\xa0led Tesla to inform all car owners to have their seats checked free of charge.Even while the company is recalling\xa0every Model S it has ever made --\xa0about 90,000 vehicles --\xa0Tesla faces considerably larger risks, from competitive threats in the luxury electric-car market to a rapidly depleting war chest.\xa0Tesla’s promise to investors that it will\xa0sell 500,000 cars per year by the end of the decade is an immense challenge, even without the\xa0mechanical flaw in its vehicles.“The recall has nothing to do mechanically\xa0with the\xa0drivetrain or the batteries. Those would be serious problems,” said Vahan Janjigian, chief investment officer at Greenwich Wealth Management and editor of the Money Masters Stock Report investment newsletter. “But aside from that, investors’ expectations are really unrealistic. The people who are bullish on Tesla seem to think there’s no\xa0limit to how fast the company can grow.”@TeslaMotors are checking seat belts at the superchargers. Takes only a few minutes. Less need for recalls. Smart! pic.twitter.com/iINHJfW49u&mdash; Bjørn Nyland (@BjornNyland) November 22, 2015Indeed, like Amazon's shareholders, Tesla's investors have little interest in whether the company earns a profit because its strategic focus is\xa0more on revenue growth and expansion. For Tesla, that means growing sales, and then growing sales even\xa0more. This year the company expects to deliver up to 52,000 cars, up from about 33,000 last year. But Tesla investors are buying shares on the bet that the automaker is on its way to selling 500,000 cars a year by 2020, a staggering 862 percent rise from this year’s target.To do that, “they have to become a car manufacturer,” Jim Chanos, Founder and President at Kynikos Associates\xa0told Bloomberg last month. Like Janjigian, Chanos is a short-seller of Tesla's stock, meaning\xa0he benefits when the shares lose value. “Becoming a car manufacturer is a lot more difficult than becoming a high-tech darling.”The auto industry is capital-intensive and requires massive production and distribution networks, which are relatively easy to build out when a company is selling 50,000 cars a year. When annual sales hit 10 times that amount or more, the automakers’ ability to successfully build, market and distribute becomes essential.As of Sept. 30, 2015, Tesla had about $1.43 billion in cash and about $2.55 billion in current liabilities, which is the money the company will need to pay over 12 months for stuff like bills from suppliers.\xa0“Tesla is running out of cash, but I’m sure they’re going to issue more stock,” said Janjigian. “The question is when do we reach the point where investors question the value of the stock.”Tesla Motors Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares dropped\xa01.01 percent, or $2.26, on Monday and closed\xa0at\xa0$217.75. The company’s share price is down nearly 10.31 percent in the past 12 months.""]"

(TSLA) Stock Slips Slightly After Recall,Sarah Berger,11/20/15,10:06 PM,"['Shares of Tesla Motors Inc. slipped Friday after the company\xa0announced it was conducting its largest-ever recall. It said\xa0all 90,000 of its Model S cars would be recalled, prompted by the receipt of a\xa0single report of a front seat\xa0belt\xa0being improperly connected, Bloomberg reported. The stock plunged 3.7 percent to $213.58 Friday, but recovered to close down a slight 0.81 percent to $220.01.""This vehicle was not involved in a crash and there were no injuries,""\xa0the company said in an e-mail to customers Friday, Bloomberg reported. ""However, in the event of a crash, a seat belt in this condition would not provide full protection.""The company initially learned of the defect two weeks ago from a customer in Europe, and swiftly moved to inspect 3,000 vehicles and its assembly process, according to Bloomberg. Although no other issues were discovered, Tesla advised its customers to book an appointment at one of about 125 Tesla service centers worldwide for an inspection of a bolt that attaches the seat belt mechanism to the body of the car, Reuters reported. Tesla might even send service technicians to customers if necessary. The majority of the affected cars were sold in the U.S., with some in Europe and Asia. \xa0""Our investigation was unable to reveal any root cause,"" the Tesla spokesman said, Reuters reported. ""We are going to look at every single car. We expect the vast majority of seat belts to be fine.""Tesla has experienced recalls in the past. Last year, the company reportedly recalled 29,222 Model S sedans because of a charging defect that could have led to a fire hazard, and in 2013 it recalled 1,228 Model S sedans because of the strength of a mounting bracket affecting the second-row seat.']"

The city’s Transportation Department demanded Tesla Motors Inc. disable the software controls two months after the company released the semiautonomous driving technology.Local traffic officials cited concern drivers would become distracted in the city’s notoriously snarled traffic by the features that allow hands-free driving. Though Tesla emphasizes customers must keep their hands on the steering wheel, the technology is advanced enough that drivers are ignoring the instructions.The move underscores a challenge the auto industry will face as it rolls out new semiautonomous driving technology globally that skirts the line between convenience and safety. A global patchwork of government traffic safety rules will hamper efforts to release these technologies uniformly. While other automakers, including Mercedes-Benz, offer similar features, Tesla has been the most aggressive in rolling out semiautonomous driving features to customers.Tesla has also taken a lead in using over-the-air software updates to add new vehicle features. In September 2014, Tesla distributed an update that raises and lowers the Model S suspension based on “remembering” where the car needs additional clearance (like speed bumps) on regular driving routes.Tesla spokeswoman Alexis Georgeson confirmed Thursday the company was compelled to remove the software in Hong Kong.“The Autosteer and Auto Lane Change functions in our recent 7.0 software update are still pending approval from Hong Kong’s\xa0Transport Department,” said a message sent to local Tesla car owners. “To ensure we comply with the country’s regulators, we will be temporarily turning off these\xa0two\xa0functions on all Model S in Hong Kong effective immediately.”Some Tesla owners were not happy with Tesla’s wireless intervention.“So today Tesla did a software update on the sly,” said “Lerxt” on the Tesla Motors Club forum, a popular venue for fans of the luxury electric cars, in a message posted Wednesday. “I expect the Communist government to do stupid things but I'm not particularly impressed with Tesla changing my software without my approval.”Another forum member claimed a similar situation in Japan, but Tesla wouldn’t comment on whether it’s facing challenges to its new technology in other markets.Tesla Motors Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares rose 1.01 percent by midday trading Thursday, to $223.23. The company’s share price has lost nearly 10 percent of its value in the past 12 months. As of Sept. 30, Tesla had $1.43 billion in cash and $2.55 billion in short-term liabilities, which are bills that come due within the next 12 months, such as payments to suppliers.""]"

During an interview with Bloomberg\xa0published Wednesday, Nest CEO Tony Fadell revealed that the Apple co-founder had considered how the company could build its own Apple Car.It was in 2008, shortly after the launch of the iPhone, that Jobs and Fadell, co-creators of the iPod and iPhone,\xa0had a few conversations over the car and what they would put inside it and what it would look like.But it was something that Jobs chose not to pursue, mainly because he wanted to focus on what would become the bread and butter of the company -- the iPhone. According to Fadell, Apple didn’t move forward with a number of ideas, such as turning the iPod into a video camera or launching a physical Apple television set. Apple experimented with the latter but ultimately shelved it after nearly a decade of research.Apple even considered the idea before Fadell’s and Jobs’ conversations, according to a 2012 court testimony by Apple senior vice president of marketing, Phil Schiller. “We were searching for what to do after iPod that would make sense,” he said according to Wired. “If we can make the iPod, what else can we do?” Apple employees tossed around ideas like making a camera, a car and other crazy stuff.”The car may not have been top priority for Apple back then, but in recent months it has significantly ramped up its efforts in the vehicle space with hundreds of car experts working on ""Project Titan,""\xa0according to the Wall Street Journal. Some have come from traditional automakers such as Ford. But Apple has also recruited a number of employees from electric carmaker, Tesla Motors.The iPhone maker may not have any experience with mass-producing cars, but in many ways the iPhone and car are similar, Fadell told Bloomberg. “A car has batteries, it has a computer, it has a motor and it has a mechanical structure,” he said. “If you look at an iPhone, it has all the same things -- it even has motor in it.” While there’s plenty of talk surrounding an Apple Car, it isn’t expected to launch until 2019.']"

They have that new second vehicle, which should help in 2016. I think overall it was a good-execution quarter.”Stock in Tesla Motors Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) hit a two-week high in aftermarket trading, rising more than 10 percent to $230.30 as investors cheered the company’s July-September quarterly results.Tesla reported an adjusted net loss of $75 million in the third quarter, or a loss of 58 cents per share, down from an adjusted gain of $3.17 million, or 3 cents per share, in the same period last year. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had\xa0expected a $55.5 million adjusted loss in the quarter.Under generally accepted accounting principles, which excludes certain definitions of quarterly revenue, Tesla reported a $230 million loss, or $1.78 per share, multiplying a loss of $74.7 million, or a loss of 52 cents per share in the same quarter last year. Wall Street expected an unadjusted loss of $95.5 million.Lower ExpectationsAnalysts lowered their 2015 sales expectations ahead of Tesla’s earnings report, citing Model X production challenges and the blowback from a recent Consumer Reports review claiming that despite Tesla’s highly praised customer service model, the Model S has reliability weaknesses.“We are lowering our 2015 X Model X delivery estimate, which is offset by higher expected S deliveries,” Ben Kallo, equity analysts for energy technology at Baird Equity Research, said in a recent research note.\xa0“Additionally, losing the Consumer Reports recommendation could have a slight impact on future Model S demand.”Baird expects a steep jump in fourth-quarter sales, to as much as 19,500 units, up from 11,603 vehicles in the third quarter, including 1,000 of the new Model X sport utility vehicle. Early-adopting customers began receiving the Model X at the end of September. Tesla said it manufactured a record 13,091 vehicles in the quarter.\xa0Cash FlowTesla is bleeding cash as it works simultaneously on a few costly projects, including building out its network of charging stations and retail stores, building the world’s largest single lithium ion battery factory in Nevada under partnership with Japan’s Panasonic Corp. and developing its $35,000 Model 3, its crucial lower-cost electric car due for 2018 delivery.Tesla raised $275 million in the third quarter on new stock it issued over the summer, helping to stem the cash bleed. But the company managed for the first time since the second quarter of 2014 to increase its cash reserve, to about $1.43 billion in the third quarter, from $1.15 billion at the end of June. Still, the company has more than $900 million less as of Sept. 30 than\xa0it did last year. Current liabilities, what the company owes over the next 12 months, declined slightly, but Tesla\xa0still owes in the short term about more than $900 million than it did this time last year.In the third quarter, spending was focused primarily on “capacity expansion and tooling associated with the Model X, as well as construction of the Gigafactory,” the company said in a shareholder letter.Bob Lutz, for one, thinks Tesla Motors is doomed. The well-known auto executive, who served among the elites at General Motors, BMW, Ford and Chrysler, cited several reasons why he thinks Elon Musk's luxury electric carmaker is destined to join a long list of failed automotive ventures.“If I were sitting in Musk's seat, I would take an urgent look at cutting cost. Not just taking cost out of the car, but reducing expense in general,” Lutz wrote in this week’s Road & Track. “At some point, they're not going to get any more money.”Lutz predicted in 2008 a big rise in motor vehicle electrification and oversaw GM’s construction of the Chevrolet Volt plug-in gas-electric hybrid. But there are plenty of others who believe in the Tesla story.""]"

The target was already adjusted\xa0from 55,000 and if it\'s cut again, it may be because the Model X\'s design -- including gull-wing doors -- will make it difficult to ramp up production, according to Fortune magazine.Tesla\xa0is expected to grow adjusted revenue by 35 percent in the July-September quarter -- to $1.26 billion, from $932.4 million in the same period last year. Analysts expect Tesla to post a fully reported loss of $95.5 million, greater than the $74.7 million in the year-ago period. Adjusting for certain charges and revenue streams that are not recognized by\xa0generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), Tesla is forecast to lose $55.5 million compared with\xa0a $3.17 million gain in the same period last year.\xa0Manufacturing shortcomings would have an even bigger impact when Tesla starts selling its mass-market Model 3 by 2017, the Journal pointed out.One more thing that could weigh on sales is Consumer Reports\' withdrawal of its recommendation of the Model S last month. That could offset any gain from endorsements it gets from celebrities like CBS ""Late Show"" host\xa0Steven Colbert\xa0and buzz from an overnight software update that gave the car self-driving capabilities.One sign the company is trying its best to boost revenue is its move to\xa0scrap the flat $100 fee it charges for a technician to pick up a car for repairs and replace it with a loaner till the owner\'s car is fixed.

But British scientists say the popular energy storage device\xa0could be obsolete by the end of the next decade, replaced by a different recipe involving oxygen.Researchers at the University of Cambridge\xa0announced they’ve created a battery prototype that\xa0overcomes some of the challenges to making the technology commercially viable, including size and amount of energy lithium oxygen (also known as lithium air) batteries can discharge. \xa0The new battery has the\xa0potential to store up to 10 times the amount of energy held in heavier lithium ion cells of comparable size, the inventors\xa0say.The implications are enough to make any tech aficionado\xa0cheer. Mobile phones could be charged once a week instead of every few hours, and electric cars could finally travel distances similar to gasoline-burning cars without the annoyance of frequent half-hour recharges. The concept battery – still easily a decade away from a market-ready prototype – would be a fifth of the weight and cost of current lithium ion batteries.“What we’ve achieved is a significant advance for this technology and suggests whole new areas for research – we haven’t solved all the problems inherent to this chemistry, but our results do show routes forward towards a practical device,” Professor Clare Grey of Cambridge’s Department of Chemistry\xa0said in the announcement of her team’s findings. The results were published in the Oct.\xa030 edition of the journal Science.    Part of the University of Cambridge's laboratory demonstration model of a lithium oxygen battery is shown in this handout picture by Tao Liu released Oct. 29, 2015.\nREUTERS/TAO LIU/HANDOUT VIA REUTERS Photo: Tao Liu/Handout via Reuters  The battery prototype relies on graphene, a lattice of carbon atoms that has the potential to radically change the way objects are made if the cost of making it can be cut. The team used a different chemistry from\xa0previous lithium oxygen studies and found it to be more efficient.The oxygen-based energy storage has the potential -- albeit possibly 20 years down the road -- to sideline the lithium ion batteries used in everyday gadgets. Lithium ion batteries have a high power-to-weight ratio and have become the standard for electric cars. Japanese electronics company Panasonic has been the largest manufacturer of lithium ion batteries for years and is the primary supplier to Tesla Motors, which uses thousands of Panasonic 18650 battery cells in each of its\xa0car battery packs.Last week, Tesla signed a deal to buy similar batteries from LG Chem, the Korean technology company that is among the largest suppliers of energy storage\xa0for electric and hybrid-electric vehicles. Japan’s Automotive Energy Supply Corporation produced the lithium ion packs for the Nissan Leaf, the world’s bestselling electric car.""]"

(NASDAQ:TSLA) hit their\xa0lowest closing price in six months\xa0Wednesday,\xa0a day after Consumer Reports\xa0issued a sobering reliability report on the\xa0Model S electric car. In a bid to\xa0meet its 2015 sales goal of\xa0at least 50,000 vehicles,\xa0the Palo Alto, California, car company sweetened\xa0its referral program.To deliver on its promise to\xa0Wall Street analysts, Tesla needs to deliver about 16,800 vehicles in the last three months of the year, up from its record 11,580 units sold in the July-September quarter.Tesla\xa0announced on its website Wednesday\xa0that current vehicle\xa0owners who persuade five people to place orders by the end of October will get\xa0a\xa0Tesla Powerwall\xa0home energy-storage pack. The successful Tesla owners will also be\xa0invited\xa0to the ribbon-cutting ceremony of the battery “Gigafactory” east of Reno, Nevada. The date for the event has not been disclosed. Tesla will release its third-quarter earnings report on Nov. 3 after markets close.The new incentive is part of the company’s referral program, announced in July, that offers discounts to new customers and the current Tesla car owners that refer them.\xa0Automakers boost incentives when they\xa0need to stimulate sales. But Tesla’s approach is characteristically unconventional. Instead of advertising low interest rates or rebates to customers, as seen in a typical car commercial, Tesla is recruiting its loyalists to act as unofficial sales reps.The company’s stock closed down 1.38 percent Wednesday to\xa0$210.09, its lowest closing price since April 21, days before the company announced its new home and utility-scale batteries. Tesla’s shares are down by nearly 8 percent over the past 12 months.\xa0On Tuesday, Consumer Reports, a widely read U.S. product reviewer, said the Model S has “too many problems to recommend,” which led to one of the biggest selloffs in the company’s stock this year.\xa0Consumer Reports had\xa0given the Model S two stellar performance reviews, but in its follow-up on reliability it found a “worse-than-average” reliability rating. According to the report, owners have reported problems including leaky sunroofs, unresponsive windshield wipers and, more significantly, unreliable electric motors that have required replacement. On a lighter note, the review says Tesla customers have been very happy with the way the company has responded to these defects, fixing them quickly and at no charge.Vehicle reliability over time is important to any automaker, but for Tesla it’s crucial.The company offers a lease-buyback price guarantee through its financing program in partnership with US Bank and Wells Fargo. Under a complex accounting practice, Tesla’s future revenue is partially contingent on the resale value of the\xa0pre-owned\xa0cars the company takes back from lease customers.“We are exposed to the risk that the vehicles’ resale value may be lower than our estimates and the volume of vehicles returned to us may be higher than our estimates, which could impact our future cash flows and/or profitability,” the company said in its last annual report on risks to its future revenue and profit.Consumers are more likely to lease electric cars than buy them, according to a recent report from CNBC. If the Model S cars it\xa0has been selling turn out to have reliability problems, then Tesla\xa0could in the future be forced to sell its used cars at below expected prices.']"

But its fortune reversed two years later, with the San Francisco-based company filing for bankruptcy in September. In a letter to the courts, co-founder Mark Seeger admitted Mission Motors was so low in cash that it couldn’t afford to hire an attorney, according to Northjersey.com.While finding funding for the company was a problem, the departure of several engineers to Apple and other companies accelerated its demise.""Mission had a great group of engineers, specifically electric drive expertise,"" former Mission Motors chief executive Derek Kaufman told Reuters.

The cars will now also have adaptive cruise control, which changes the speed to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front, something that has been available in some luxury car options for a while.    Tesla Model S vehicles purchased since September 2014 have radar, ultrasonic and camera modules that provide an array of coverage surrounding the vehicle.

This feature wasn\'t always available in our brief test-drive—where lane lines weren\'t visible, or where traffic was blocking the car\'s view of the lane markings, Autopilot simply wouldn\'t respond to the turn signal. But when the car was satisfied with the conditions, it executed lane changes without drama.']"

(TSLA) Has Lost $3.5B In Value Since The Model X Debut,Angelo Young,10/09/15,2:54 PM,"[""Tesla Motors has had a bad week. After three investment banks downgraded its stock in the wake of the Sept. 29 debut of its\xa0Model X sports utility vehicle, the Palo Alto, California, electric car\xa0maker has shed more than $3.5 billion in market valuation.The latest hit to Tesla came Friday when Barclays\xa0lowered its 12-month stock price target by $10 to $180 per share -- down from the stock's current\xa0price of $221. The investment bank cited Model X production challenges that could slow Tesla's plan\xa0to start producing the $35,000 Model 3 by 2017, which is critical to the company’s goals.“While the bulls believe Tesla will be the next Ford, we see many challenges ahead for Tesla and argue the ‘crossing the chasm’ is harder than it looks,” Brian Johnson, Barclays’ auto industry equity analyst, said in a research note. The “chasm” refers to Tesla's shift\xa0from being a boutique maker of pricey electric cars to a mass-producer of green machines more people can afford.The statement echoes similar remarks made this past week by Morgan Stanley and Baird & Co. auto analysts, who lamented the higher-than-expected\xa0price for the Model X and raised concern that aspiring Model S owners would simply upgrade to the Model X, cannibalizing sales.“The Model X price appears to have an as much as $25,000 higher average transaction price than the Model S and easily $10,000 to $15,000 higher than we had expected,” Adam Jonas, chief automotive analyst at Morgan Stanley, said in a note earlier this week.Tesla has yet to announce the prices for different Model X versions, but the $132,000 for the special Signature edition Model X that’s going to early customers raises concern the SUV would be considerably more expensive than the $70,000 entry-level Model S luxury sedan.Tesla will not become the next Ford anytime soon, if ever, and the 13.5 percent drop in share price over the past 12 months seems like a rational adjustment.\xa0Tesla Motors Inc. (Nasdaq:TSLA) shares closed down 2.67 percent to $220.68 on Friday. The stock has lost 10.53 percent of its value since the Model X was unveiled in Fremont, California, on Sept. 29.Tesla sold a fraction\xa0of the number of cars Ford delivered last year, but investors currently value Tesla at about half that of the venerable\xa0Dearborn, Michigan, maker of Mustangs and F-Series pickup trucks.

In an interview with the German business newspaper\xa0Handelsblatt Thursday, the Tesla Motors CEO hit out at the company, which has, over the past year, recruited\xa0several former Tesla engineers.“We always jokingly call Apple the ‘Tesla Graveyard,’” Musk said, responding to a question about Apple hiring Tesla’s “most important engineers.”“They have hired people we’ve fired … If you don’t make it at Tesla, you go work at Apple. I’m not kidding,” he added.Earlier this year, Reuters reported that Apple had hired more than 60 former Tesla employees, including several hardware, software, manufacturing and supply chain engineers. The move is being seen as Apple’s attempts toward studying self-driving technology and electric cars, and developing such a vehicle over the next few years.According to a recent report by the Wall Street Journal, the iPhone maker has been ramping up its efforts to build an electric car, and has designated it internally as a “committed project.” The company plans to launch the car in 2019, the Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter.When asked about Apple’s alleged foray into the electric car market, Musk said it was “the next logical thing to finally offer a significant innovation.”“It’s good that Apple is moving and investing in this direction,” he said. “But cars are very complex compared to phones or smartwatches. You can’t just go to a supplier like Foxconn and say -- Build me a car.”\xa0\xa0In the interview, Musk also took a swipe at German carmakers, who, he said, are “not accepting the future.”“The country was a pioneer in internal combustion technology. But if you cling to the past, you won’t get to the future. It’s time to start building a fundamentally new generation of cars,” he said. “You see what’s happened with the current diesel scandal at Volkswagen.

The cost rises to nearly $150,000 once options are piled on, and the company has yet to announce a pricing scheme for different trim levels.“The recently launched Model X SUV is an impressive proof of concept for design, performance\xa0and utility that the Tesla brand has established in the marketplace,” said the note from Adam Jonas, chief automotive analyst at Morgan Stanley. “However, the Model X price appears to have an as much as $25,000 higher average transaction price than the Model S and easily $10,000 to $15,000 higher than we had expected.”@elonmusk pic.twitter.com/Kb4YTqPgIn&mdash; Roberto Baldwin (@strngwys) October 2, 2015Ben Kallo, clean technology equity researcher at Baird & Co., echoed concern\xa0over uncertainties about the ramp-up of Model X deliveries. “It remains unclear of when initial X deliveries will occur (besides launch event deliveries), and production ramp could take longer than expected,” Kallo wrote in a note on Wednesday.\xa0“Given the complexity of the vehicle, we believe the ramp will be slower than expected.”Tesla Motors Inc. (Nasdaq:TSLA) stock price was down 4.28 percent to $231.12 in mid-day trading on Wednesday,\xa0its lowest price since late August when global markets were rocked by growing concern over the Chinese economic downturn. But this time, the drop seemed specific to Tesla and its ability to meet\xa0sales goals.\xa0Tesla's share price has lost 10 percent since the start of last week's session.\xa0Even before the price of the Model X was announced there was concern about whether the company\xa0could\xa0meet its minimum 50,000-car sales target for the year. The company said on Friday\xa0it delivered 11,580 vehicles to customers in the July to\xa0September quarter, putting 2015 year-to-date sale volume at 33,117 units.Morgan Stanley slashed the number of Model X deliveries for the rest of the year by about half its previous estimate, to 1,506 units. This means Tesla would need to deliver those Model X vehicles plus 15,327 Model S luxury electric cars by the end of December. That would be an unprecedented 46 percent jump in sales from the third quarter to the fourth.Even with the typical\xa0holiday bump in luxury cars sales, this would be an unusually high leap in sales in such a short period of time --\xa0one that would most certainly garner serious overtime for the company’s Fremont, California, factory workers.\xa0One of the main concerns about missing sales targets is the snowball effect on future benchmark dates, especially the rollout of the $35,000 Model 3 due\xa0to customers in 2018. Musk wants to grow annual sales from about 31,655 last year to 500,000 by 2020, a pace of growth that’s unheard of in the modern automotive industry.""]"

A shortage of charging facilities has long been a roadblock for sales by the makers of electric cars, ranging from the domestic BYD Co. Ltd. to its U.S. rival Tesla Motors Inc., as well as for government plans to rein in high levels of pollution.China has made some progress on car-charging infrastructure, but its approach has lacked coordination, National Energy Administration deputy head Zheng Zhajie said. ""It\'s like with phone chargers, it\'s a bit all over the place,"" he told Xinhua. ""Everyone has a pile of different chargers and a pile of batteries. Now we\'re trying to improve things, moving towards unifying and standardizing.""China aims to equip at least one in 10 public car-park facilities for electric-car charging, he said, adding that the State Council, or cabinet, would soon issue guidance for the infrastructure rollout.China cut taxes on small-engine cars last week in an effort to revive its wider automobile market, the world\'s biggest since 2009, although a recent economic slowdown has weighed on sales. But one bright spot this year has been sales of green cars, which have almost quadrupled from the 2014 figure. The government sees electric cars as China\'s best shot at closing a competitive gap with global rivals who have a 100-year head start in traditional combustion engines.China has rolled out aggressive targets for vehicle fuel efficiency that will grow gradually stricter until 2020, when its standards will exceed those of the U.S. and roughly match Japan.The government has also offered tax cuts for green vehicles and proposed extending subsidies, mostly for domestic producers, to help automakers meet these targets.(Reporting by Adam Jourdan; Editing by Clarence Fernandez)']"

While sales of popular electric and gas-electric hybrids have plummeted, wealthy Tesla Motors loyalists continue to drive sales of the $75,000 Model S.Tesla reported late Friday it delivered 11,580 vehicles in the July-September quarter, up from 11,507 units\xa0in the previous quarter. The company delivered 33,117 cars to customers in the first nine months of the year, a 52 percent increase from the same period last year.Tesla delivered its Model X sport utility vehicle to its first customers Tuesday, but the company said only a small number of those vehicles are included in the latest sales data. Unlike other automakers, Tesla only reports sales numbers at the end of each quarter.The staggering jump in Model S sales this year could use some perspective. Electric car sales make up only a tiny fraction of total auto sales in the U.S. -- well below 1 percent. However, Tesla is largely immune to the problem green-cars generally have, that U.S. demand for electric cars drops as gasoline prices fall.“Low fuel prices have certainly had a detrimental impact in marketing of vehicles whose value proposition is fuel savings,” said Michelle Krebs, a senior analyst for AutoTrader.com in Detroit. “The outlook isn’t good either. We expect fuel prices to be down for the foreseeable future.”A crude oil supply glut fostered by a U.S. fracking boom and a downturn in demand from China has sent U.S. gasoline prices to lows unseen since the 2009 Great Recession. Gasoline prices in most parts of the country remain comfortably below $3 a gallon, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. GasBuddy.com, a popular online gasoline-price tracker, reporteds prices below $2 a gallon in much of the U.S. South.Low pump prices haven’t boded well for popular alternatives to regular combustion-engine cars, such as the Nissan Leaf electric mini, the Chevrolet Volt gas-electric hybrid, the plug-in version of the Prius hybrid or Ford’s Fusion Energi. Compared to recent sales of the most popular electrified cars, Tesla’s numbers look great.But there’s a catch. As a small automotive manufacturer with tremendous ambitions -- Tesla wants to sell 500,000 cars a year by 2020 -- the company must meet important targets. Earlier this year the company lowered its 2015 sales estimate from 55,000 to as little as 50,000. Its third quarter performance was effectively a tie with the second quarter.    US gasoline prices have dipped to lows unseen since 2009, amid the Great Recession. This has driven down demand for electric and gas-electric hybrid plug-ins.

The HEPA filters are up to 10 times the size of filters found in other cars.On Tuesday, more than a year after\xa0his initial deadline,\xa0Musk\xa0handed\xa0over the first Model X luxury electric SUVs to\xa0customers. The car is significantly more expensive than the original Model S, with prices starting\xa0from $132,000. One of the most talked about features of the new Model X are the ""falcon wing"" rear doors that mimic the iconic doors of the DeLorean, immortalized in the ""Back to the Future"" movies. Tesla said that due to their double-hinged design, they can open in as little as 12 inches of space, thanks to ultrasonic sensors, and take around six seconds to open fully.    The futuristic looking Tesla Model X features 360-degree sonar, forward-facing cameras and the iconic falcon wing rear doors. Photo: Tesla  Indeed the Model X is crammed fully with technology, including\xa0forward-looking cameras, radar and\xa0a 360-degree sonar, which will enable the company to roll out its semi-autonomous technology called AutoPilot that will bring automatic steering, accelerating and braking on motorways as well\xa0as a self-park feature -- but only in countries that\xa0have updated their road laws to allow it.The Model X promises a top speed of 155\xa0mph and will go from zero to\xa060\xa0mph in just 3.2 seconds. In terms of range, the 90\xa0kWh battery pack will allow 250 miles on a single charge.“Consumers have been buying SUVs in droves over the last couple years, yet there are very few electric vehicles in SUV form,” said Akshay Anand, an analyst at Kelley Blue Book. “The Model X aims to fill that need, all with a brand that consumers seem to aspire to.”']"

Tesla Motors’ Twitter feed is also likely to be active with images and messages from the event.Though the world\xa0won’t learn price or other details until Tuesday evening’s event, the Model X will not be inexpensive, even by luxury SUV standards. This relegates the SUV to wealthy, early adopters, many of whom live in the company’s home state of California, the biggest market for the Tesla Model S in the U.S.\xa0Globally, Tesla’s strength lies in Norway, where generous electric-car tax breaks give\xa0the Model S a huge price advantage over its gas-burning peers, like the Audi S6.“There\'s little doubt in the marketplace that Model X will be successful with its audience of wealthy early adopters,” said Jessica Caldwell, director of industry anlysis at Edmunds.com.\xa0“But today\'s launch is a quick stop on a longer and more important journey.\xa0 The real test for Tesla comes down the road when it launches the Model 3, when we\'ll learn for sure if mainstream car buyers are ready to make the switch from gas to electric.”The $35,000 Telsa Model 3 is due out in 2018 as the company uses the revenue from the sale of its luxury models to bring down battery prices.    Elon Musk doesn\'t believe ""a single person or even a small company"" has the ""extensive engineering validation capability"" required to produce an autonomous driving system. Musk\'s comments came in response to a former hacker\'s claims that he\'s done it. Photo: Tesla Motors  While low gasoline prices have\xa0been luring consumers away from electric cars like the Nissan Leaf, Tesla has been shielded from the drop in demand, largely because its wealthy buyers are less concerned about fuel prices and are buying Tesla cars as status symbols.A\xa0detailed but unofficial tally from Tesla fans\xa0indicates\xa0customers have reserved about 28,000 Model X SUVs, mostly in the U.S.Tesla Motors Inc. (NYSE:TSLA) share price was up 1.67 percent to $252.59 in Tuesday morning trading.The Model X was initially scheduled for a late 2014 release, but the car’s production and delivery dates were delayed three times\xa0so Tesla could focus on Model S production. Late last year, Musk said in a conference call the Model X\'s falcon wing doors posed an immense engineering challenge to ensure they work properly once the vehicle enters full production.""It\'s worth saying that making one of something is quite easy,"" he said during a third quarter 2014 conference call. ""Making lots of something consistently\xa0that\'s going to last a long time is extremely hard. In fact, it is way harder to make the machine that makes the machine than it is to make the machine in the first place.""In August, Tesla downgraded its annual sales forecast for the year, from 55,000 to as few as 50,000. Meeting expected sales, revenue and profit margin targets is vital to keeping investors satisfied. The company has been bleeding cash as it works on various fronts to reach a goal of selling 500,000 electric cars a year by 2020, including the $35,000 Model 3 due in 2018.A video\xa0recently posted to YouTube shows the Tesla Model X “falcon wing” door in action in the parking lot of what appears to be the company’s Fremont, California, facility.

But it is Tesla, the company founded by Elon Musk, which is set to deliver on the promise of this new era of motoring before anyone else.Speaking to a Danish\xa0TV station, Musk outlined his vision for the electric and autonomous car market in the next five years, making some bold claims about the improvements in range coming very soon:“My guess is that we could probably break 1,000 kilometers (620 miles)\xa0within a year or two. I’d say 2017 for sure…in 2020 I guess we could probably make a car go 1,200km\xa0(750 miles).\xa0I think maybe 5–10 percent\xa0a year [improvement], something like that.”The current range on the Tesla Model S on a single change with its 85kWh battery pack is just 426km, according to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), meaning Musk sees a dramatic improvement in the coming 12–24 months.\xa0However, a Model S was recently driven a total of 723 kilometers\xa0in the U.S. on a single charge -- though this was driving at an average of just 24kmph.Tesla is the market leader in terms of range, which is down to the fact it takes Panasonic’s battery cells and repackages them itself to get the most out of each charge. The company will hand over the first of its Model X SUVs\xa0Tuesday near its factory in California as it looks to consolidate its position in a market which will see increased competition in the coming years.    Franz Von Holzhausen, Chief Designer for Tesla, speaks next to the Model X Concept SUV at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit, Michigan January 15, 2013. Telsa is investing heavily in the new vehicle in 2014 ahead of its expected release next spring.  Photo: Reuters/James Fassinger  As well as talking about alleviating range anxiety, Musk also spoke about autonomy, saying that he thinks fully autonomous vehicles will be ready by 2018. “My guess for when we’ll have full autonomy is about three years, approximately three years,” Musk said.With most industry experts suggesting 2020 as a realistic date for when the first fully autonomous vehicles will be ready to take to the roads, Musk did add a note of caution to his prediction, suggesting regulators will be the cause of delay, rather than the technology:“Regulators will not allow full autonomy for one to two years --\xa0maybe one to three years --\xa0after that,” Musk said. “It depends on the particular market; in some markets the regulators will be more forward leaning than others. But in terms of when [full autonomy] will be technologically possible, I think three years.”Tesla is currently testing out its own autonomous system called AutoPilot which Musk said\xa0will be rolled out to all Model S vehicles by the end of October. The system in its current form provides automatic steering, accelerating and braking on motorways, but only in countries which have updated their road laws to allow it.The push for autonomy is being spear-headed not only by technology-focused companies like Apple, Google and Tesla, but also by\xa0traditional motor companies like Ford, BMW and Daimler, which\xa0are all testing their own autonomous vehicles as they attempt to keep pace with the newcomers in the market.']"

Seeks White House To Pressure China On Restrictions On US Carmakers: Report,Mark Hanrahan,08/29/15,5:22 AM,"[""Tesla Motors Inc. is seeking to get the Obama administration to pressure Chinese President Xi Jinping to make it easier for U.S. automakers to operate in China, during his state visit to the U.S. next month, according to a report from the Wall Street Journal.According to the Journal, Tesla's move comes as several new Chinese-backed electric car startups are emerging in the U.S., presenting a new wave of competition for Tesla. Foreign carmakers who wish to assemble vehicles in China must take on a Chinese partner, which presents them with challenges in operating there, and puts them at a disadvantage when compared with Chinese companies operating in the U.S.“The China-owned companies are not expected to sell controlling stakes to American companies and are free from other trade hurdles that we face,” Tesla spokesman Ricardo Reyes told the paper.Tesla's move comes as it\xa0is facing increasing competition in China from local firms.One such firm is the Leshi Internet Info & Tech Corp., owned by billionaire Jia Yueting, which aims to unveil an electric car at the Beijing motor show in 2016, according to a report from Bidness Etc. China's government is aiming to boost sales of electric vehicles, as part of a range of measures it is perusing to curb the country's serious air pollution problem, and has been supportive of domestic entrepreneurs who want to invest in the industry.The company also faces competition from the Youxia X in the country, which will be priced between $32,200 and $48,300, and compete with the upcoming Model 3. The Youxia X bears a striking similarity in its design to Tesla's Model S sedan.Tesla made a poor start in the Chinese market. It failed to make its target of getting a third of its global sales from this country in 2014, and sold just 2,499 Model S units there last year, out of its\xa031,700 worldwide 2014 sales of the model, according to Seeking Alpha. The company has managed to make progress since its market debut in China, and now commands 80 percent of imported plug-in hybrid and electric vehicle sales.""]"
https://www.ibtimes.com/tesla-motors-inc-tsla-shares-rally-after-model-s-p85d-review-results-released-2071899,Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Shares Rally After Model S P85D Review Results Released,Angelo Young,08/27/15,4:14 PM,"[""Tesla Motors Inc.’s share price shot up Thursday after Consumer Reports gave the Tesla Model S P85D its highest road-test score on record. The\xa0sportier dual-motor version of the world’s only fully electric-powered luxury sedan received kudos from Consumer Reports about two years after it gave the single-motor version of the Model S its highest score\xa0until then.Essentially, the Palo Alto electric car maker beat its own Consumer Reports record with recently introduced enhancements to its premium model, which starts at $105,000 before state and federal government electric-car tax credits and incentives.“The car’s thrust is forceful and immediate,” says the magazine. “Its near-instant g-forces can otherwise be achieved only by leaping off a building --\xa0literally.”Tesla’s share price was knocked down to a four-month low earlier this week during a massive sell-off of U.S. stocks in the wake of growing concern over China’s economic slowdown and yuan devaluation. But reacting to the positive news, investors piled back into Tesla (Nasdaq:TSLA), pushing its share price up 8.07 percent to $242.99 on Thursday afternoon, well above the Nasdaq’s 2.45 percent jump. The company stock is on track to recover what it’s lost over the past two weeks.The Consumer Reports review affirms not just the Tesla Motors engineering feat; it also underscores the superior torque performance of electric motors. Unlike gasoline-powered cars, electric car engines push out the maximum torque from a stopped position, compared to the rev-up time needed to get gas engines to reach maximum torque. This means, for example, that a Model S smokes most gas-powered sports cars for the first 100 yards or so before a more powerful sports car overtakes it.The reviewers clocked a 0-60 mph acceleration of 3.5 seconds, which is slightly lower than Tesla’s advertised 3.1 seconds\xa0but still impressive for a car in its price range and style. A $10,000 so-called “Ludicrous Speed Upgrade” option for the P85D purports to increase that acceleration to 2.1 seconds, higher than most street-legal sports cars. Electric motors are quiet, too, giving the Model S a unique stealthy performance typically ascribed to engines that growl.The down side: Unlike comparable luxury cars, Tesla skimps on interior opulence, the reviewers said, and the ride is firm, which means even small bumps and imperfections on the road are felt compared with comparable luxury cars. And reliability is hardly Honda-like, with owner-surveys giving the Model S an average rating.Last year, Consumer Reports reported “glitches” in the basic Model S. Minor problems, like the 17-inch center console screen --\xa0a key feature of the vehicle --\xa0going dark unexpectedly appeared; it's\xa0a crucial issue considering most of the vehicle’s commands are operated through it. For its part, Tesla has said numerous times that all Model S vehicles are constantly improved through over-the-air updates.“It might be tempting to guess that its reliability score will go down,” the report said. “The reality is, it might --\xa0depending on the frequency and severity of problems reported by our subscribers and whether they show that reliability is below average.”Car & Driver magazine also gives the Model S high marks for styling and preface\xa0but said it faced challenges in long-distance road trips.“After pitching the idea of driving the Tesla to Virginia to multiple coworkers, nobody wanted to tag along\xa0on a trip they\xa0felt would end in\xa0firsthand experience with Tesla Motors’ roadside assistance,” the magazine said. One problem was that Tesla’s on board computer kept recalculating range, especially as the driver headed south and turned on the A/C and watched the distance to the next Tesla Supercharger station (where free energy is provided to Tesla owners) become increasingly worrisome.In some cases, the driver had to turn around to make it to the nearest charging outlet. In the end, a 10-11 “pleasure cruise” with a gas-powered car became a nearly 15-hour road trip carefully monitoring the battery gauge and figuring out where to stop for a recharge.""]"

Tesla CEO Elon Musk plans to purchase $20 million worth of the new shares.Morgan Stanley’s bullish Tesla analyst Adam Jonas said in a research note\xa0Monday\xa0the maker of the Model S luxury electric car could be 18 months away from announcing plans to offer an Uber-like service that would see Tesla bypass selling its cars to ride-hailing companies and get into the so-called shared mobility business on its own. This could happen as early as 2018, Jonas said, as the company’s $35,000 Model 3 electric car is being introduced.If Tesla were to introduce a shared mobility service, Jonas said it would add\xa0$244 to the future price of Tesla stock. The bank upgraded the company’s one-year price target to $465, one the highest among the analysts currently tracking Tesla.Thilo Koslowski, vice president and automotive practice leader at Gartner\xa0Inc., said this is certainly something Tesla would be considering just like other global automakers, including Ford Motor and BMW that already are experimenting with shared mobility services in select locations.“Uber’s success is inspiring a lot visions for other companies and it would make sense for Tesla to do this as well,” Koslowski said. “It would be too early for Tesla to be making decisions like this, however. The company needs to make money in its core business.”The company is in the midst of rolling out three new models by 2020 -- the Model X, Model 3 and second generation Roadster -- while building the world’s largest single battery “gigafactory” near Reno, Nevada, growing its Tesla Energy \xa0power storage business, and fleshing out its global network of charging stations and retail outlets. If Tesla is poised to offer something like Uber, it could also be a distraction of its main goal: to make and sell mass market electric cars, and to offer residential, commercial and grid-scale electricity storage units.If Tesla is planning to enter the ride-hailing business, it’s being coy about its plans. Uber CEO Travis Kalanick said last month if Tesla makes a viable self-driving car by 2020, he would buy every single one of them. The comment elicited a question from Jonas during the second-quarter earnings conference call earlier this month.Asked Jonas: “Is this a real business opportunity for Tesla, supplying cars to ride-hailing firms, or does Tesla just cut out the middleman and sell on-demand electric mobility services directly from the company on its own platform?”Musk replied: “That's an insightful question. ... I don't think I should answer it.”""]"

Two years after it filed for bankruptcy amid sagging sales of its Fisker plug-in hybrid, the company has signed an 11-year factory lease in Moreno Valley, California, the Los Angeles Times reported Wednesday.The Wanxiang Group, a Chinese automotive company that purchased Fisker in 2013, paid $30 million to lease a 555,670-square-foot facility, the report said. Fisker plans to restart production the Karma,\xa0its electric hybrid, which could return to the consumer market by mid-2016. Company officials said Fisker will have 150 full-time manufacturing employees by the time production begins, the Press Enterprise reported.“Fisker believes in the quality, work ethic and competitiveness of manufacturing in the USA,” Jim Taylor, Fisker’s chief marketing officer, said in a statement. “California’s natural beauty, trend setting, technology\xa0and environmental focus are perfectly aligned with our Karma re-launch.”It’s unclear what role company founder Henrik Fisker will play in the relaunch. “I couldn’t answer that question. I am not certain about my role, but I am happy that what we created is not for nothing,” he told the Times. About 20 of the Karma’s original designers are involved in the renewed work, he said.The new Fisker will be in direct competition with CEO Elon Musk’s Tesla, which produces a full-electric vehicle and also has a factory in California. Tesla now builds 50,000 electric cars per year, the Times noted.Tesla shares rose nearly 2 percent to $242.25 in early trading Thursday.Though praised for its sleek and innovative Model S electric sedan, Tesla has encountered problems of its own.

Tesla purportedly loses more than $4,000 for each Model S sold.Fisker Automotive filed for bankruptcy in 2013 after a product recall forced the company to halt production of its signature vehicle. The automaker produced fewer than 2,500 Karmas, which sold at $100,000, before it closed its doors. During its initial run, Fisker lost about $35,000 on each Karma it built, a 2013 Reuters report says.Wanxiang bought up Fisker’s assets for about $149 million in 2014.

The sales-forecast downgrade that caused Tesla's stock to nosedive Thursday isn't an indication that fewer drivers want to own the company's sexy electric vehicles. It's just that Tesla needs more time to teach its robotic\xa0factory workers new tasks associated with producing\xa0the Model X sport utility vehicle.There was a lot to digest in the Tesla Motors Inc.\xa0second-quarter earnings report this week, but one thing we learned was that the carmaker's robots require a bit of training before they can do their jobs. The company reported mixed revenue and net income results\xa0but\xa0also lowered its 2015 sales forecast from 55,000 units to as little as 50,000. The news pushed the company’s stock price to a three-month low Thursday morning as some investors dumped company stock.Typically, a reduced\xa0sales forecast\xa0implies\xa0lower-than-expected demand, but in Tesla's case the drop in future deliveries has more to do with the immense challenges of redirecting a robot-reliant\xa0manufacturing operation while entering\xa0a new phase of\xa0business.For the first time, Tesla Motors is building two models on one general assembly line, the Model S luxury electric car and the Model X SUVs. And to do that, the company must\xa0essentially teach its robots to handle the new fabrication process for the Model X.“There are parts of the factory that are much more automated than other parts,” Tesla Motors CEO Elon Musk said during a conference call Wednesday. “In terms of programming the robots, it varies quite a bit in terms of … how difficult that programming is … The Model X is, I think, a particularly challenging car to build.

Because Tesla\xa0isn’t expected to turn a profit for years, sales growth is critical.“We do think it’s going to be quite a challenging production round on the [Model] X, and we only want to deliver great cars,” CEO Elon Musk said during a conference call Wednesday. “We don’t want to drive to the number beyond our ability to deliver high-quality vehicles.”Tesla reduced its production estimates for next year from an average of about 2,000 vehicles a week to 1,600 to 1,800 vehicles a week.Tesla said it still expects to deliver the first Model X sport utility vehicles to customers by the end of September and that it produced a record 12,807 cars in the three months ended June 30. “Since Model S and Model X are produced on the same general assembly line, Model X production challenges could slow Model S production,” said the letter to shareholders.Tesla Motors reported an unadjusted loss of $184 million, or $1.45 per share, for\xa0the three months ended June 30, compared to\xa0a loss of $61.9 million, or 50 cents per share, in the same period last year. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters has forecast an unadjusted loss of $126.1 million, or $1.02 a share.The company reported $1.20 billion in revenue for the quarter, up from $857.5 million in the year-ago quarter. Analysts had expected about $1.18 billion.The company ended the quarter with $1.15 billion in cash and cash equivalents, and spent $359 million in the quarter. Most of the cash burn had to do with retooling the Fremont, California, factory to accommodate Model X manufacturing.""]"

(Nasdaq:TSLA) is\xa0entering an important new phase in its push to overtake\xa0Nissan Motors\xa0as the automotive history’s biggest electric-car manufacturer. If all goes according to CEO Elon Musk's plan, the first Tesla Model X\xa0sport utility vehicles will hit the streets\xa0by late September. And by next summer, the auto world will get its\xa0first peek at a prototype for the modestly priced Tesla for Everyman: the Model 3, due out in early 2018.Musk's blueprint also includes an expansion of Tesla’s automotive and energy storage production, and hitting\xa0milestones in the construction of the company’s multibillion-dollar “Gigafactory” battery facility in Nevada.Of course, as all these gears spin in unison, a lot could go wrong.The company is banking on the notion that it can\xa0quickly transition from a boutique manufacturer\xa0to a mass-producer of electric cars, as it attempts\xa0to\xa0grow from the roughly 32,000 cars it sold last year to at least 500,000 by 2020. And Tesla's energy unit, too\xa0is dependent on an assumption that businesses and homeowners will rapidly adopt its\xa0power storage units.But\xa0any number of\xa0missteps\xa0could scuttle\xa0Tesla's growth. The company, for instance, is\xa0just one automotive safety recall away from the entire operation crashing down on the heads of its exuberant shareholders.For now, Tesla's growth\xa0engine is running smoothly.“We think demand for the Model S will remain strong throughout 2015 in the U.S. and Europe. Additionally, [Tesla] has several significant milestones coming up over the next 18 months,” Benjamin Kallo, a new-energy research analyst\xa0at Baird, said in a research note Tuesday.What matters most\xa0for Tesla is\xa0maintaining its sales momentum. The company has said it will deliver 55,000 cars in 2015. \xa0It delivered\xa021,537 in the first six months of the year. Even if it hits its goal,\xa0the company isn’t expected to turn a profit anytime soon, and it will likely see costs increase during this next phase of development.“Certain costs should rise as the company expands internationally as it invests in technology and infrastructure for the upcoming Model X SUV,” Standard & Poor’s equity analyst Efraim Level\xa0said in a research note last week.    Tesla sold about 22,400 cars in 2013 and about 31,600 cars last year. The company is expected to have sold about 35,500 cars in 2015 by the end of September. It expects to deliver 55,000 cars this year.

The stock is up 19 percent since the start of the year. The share price came close to an all-time high in July. The company's lack of profits\xa0hasn't deterred\xa0its\xa0growth-stock investors from bidding up the share price nearly 800 percent since the summer of 2012.Tesla’s share price was up 1.73 percent in midday trading Tuesday, to $264.49, down from a\xa052-week high of $291.42. The company’s highest closing price, $286.04, was reached Sept. 4, 2014, after the location of the Gigafactory was announced. Tesla struck its second-highest closing price July 2 after its second-quarter sales results were released.Tesla will announce\xa0second-quarter financial\xa0results after markets close Wednesday. Company watchers can listen to Musk\xa0talk about important developments and issues facing his company by clicking here at 5:30 p.m. EDT Wednesday.Tesla is expected to book a wider loss of $126.1 million, or $1.02 a share, for the April-June quarter. That compared with\xa0a loss of $61.9 million, or 50 cents per share, in the same period last year, analysts polled by Thomson Reuters said.But revenue -- the most critical number for Tesla right now -- is expected to be the highest on record, at $1.17 billion, up from $857.5 million in the year-ago quarter. The company’s revenue first broke through the billion-dollar mark in the fourth quarter of last year. Efraim Levy, an equities analyst for Standard & Poor's,\xa0expects revenue to grow 62 percent this year as Tesla sells significantly more cars this year than last.

Last month, three Southern California schools were among the\xa0first major customers to sign up for Tesla stationary battery storage since April’s announcement.Last month, Tesla introduced pricing and hardware options for the Model S. The company lowered the price of the entry-level Model S to $70,000 for a single-motor powertrain carrying with a 70 kWh battery pack that gives up about 230 miles of range. The company also added a “Ludicrous Speed” upgrade that starts at $118,000 for a 0-60 mph time of 2.8 seconds, giving the Model S the performance typically ascribed to million-dollar supercars.In the past week, Tesla introduced an incentive program to entice loyal Model S owners to lure like-minded new customers into the Tesla fold. On Friday, Musk announced progress in a soon-to-be-released over-the-air firmware upgrade that will add automatic steering for highway driving and automatic-parking capabilities to existing Model S cars.\xa0Almost ready to release highway autosteer and parallel autopark software update&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 31, 2015The China FactorLuxury carmakers have been watching China with wary eyes. On Tuesday, German automaker BMW warned that China's\xa0recent economic slowdown\xa0could affect its global sales. BMW's sales have been sliding in the world’s biggest car market, where foreign luxury automakers are\xa0having trouble luring customers to cars that cost less than the Model S.This doesn’t bode well for Tesla’s China ambitions and could make 2015 as disappointing\xa0as\xa0last year. Tesla has reorganized in China and stepped up its marketing efforts this year, but macroeconomic pressure could negate the efforts. Wealthy Chinese buyers need to be convinced that they won’t run out of power in a six-figure electric car while stranded in the country’s legendary traffic jams. And now there are fewer of those wealthy Chinese customers.But so far, Tesla’s Chinese challenges aren’t expected to have a measurable impact on short-term sales. The focus\xa0is on the U.S. and European markets, and with a new vehicle poised to hit showrooms, Tesla should get a\xa0sales boost that will carry it into next year.""]"

Tesla shares hit an all-time high of $286.04 on Sept.\xa04, 2014, when the company\xa0announced the location of its “gigafactory”\xa0battery plant near Reno, Nevada.Earlier this year, Tesla unveiled its Powerwall and Powerpack energy storage systems for home, business, utility and off-grid purposes. The Nevada gigafactory is being constructed to produce 35 gigawatt hours (GWh) of battery storage capacity, including 15 GWh for energy storage. (One GWh is a standard energy\xa0measurement that represents\xa01 million kilowatt hours; a high-end Model S uses a 90 kWh battery pack.) UBS estimates that Tesla would need to capture 75 percent of the energy storage market in 2020 to utilize its planned storage capacity.Here are five takeaways from UBS’s bearish note on Tesla’s prospects.* Tesla would need to grow its luxury car market share from 0.6 percent today to 8.5 percent by 2020, making it six times larger than Porsche, twice as large as Lexus and just behind Audi and BMW in terms of annual sales. “These automakers will not cede share easily,” says the note.* UBS’s best-case scenario, based on the company's projected future sales and profit margins,\xa0suggests the company's\xa012-month stock price should be\xa0$300,\xa0or roughly $31 less than the current stock price. The downside\xa0scenario, where future\xa0sales and profit margins are less than expected, would\xa0put\xa0the company's 12-month\xa0price at $48 a share, way under\xa0its current price.* The company’s current stock price assumes it will be selling 1.5 million cars and using all of its battery production capacity annually by 2025. UBS believes this is “unlikely.”* To sell 1.5 million cars by 2025 “would require adding two more assembly plants and probably two more gigafactories” at a cost of $6 billion to $9 billion.* Early orders for Tesla’s Powerwall and Powerpack energy storage units are misleading. “Customers did not put down deposits, so these are just solicitations of interest,” says the report. Early adopters will drive up initial orders, but making a leap to the mass market will be a big challenge.""]"

It prefers the Silicon Valley playbook inspired by Apple and its direct-to-customer retail\xa0model.“They’ve always been open to the best talents, pulling from other industries,” said Andrea James, senior research analyst at Dougherty & Company who specializes in emerging technologies.\xa0“They’re following a retail-like mindset, selling cars out of shopping malls, so this makes sense.”This is the second executive Tesla has pulled from the world of retail clothing. In 2010, the company\xa0lured George Blankenship, a former executive for The Gap, away from Apple Inc. to set up Tesla’s showrooms.Blankenship’s retirement in 2013 left Jerome Guillen, a former executive for German auto giant Daimler, in charge of Tesla’s hefty global sales strategy. But earlier this year, Tesla announced it would break up the world into three key regions – North America, Europe and Asia – and return Guillen to his previous role as the company’s customer-satisfaction czar.\xa0""Jerome has not been demoted in any way,"" Tesla said in a statement to Automotive News in March. ""He has been and remains part of the senior executive team.”Theodore O’Neill, senior research analysts at Ascendiant Capital Markets, who follows companies involved in clean technologies and alternative energy, says Tesla is due to begin taking Blankenship’s retail vision to the next level, and Srivats will play an important role. Current Tesla stores display Model S chassis and have interactive displays and Tesla baseball caps and smartphone covers for sale.\xa0But with Model X crossover\xa0SUV deliveries starting later this year, as well as the lower-priced Model 3 expected out by 2018, Tesla’s stores will need\xa0to be revamped.“To do that you need someone who owns the retail experience. You won’t find that person in the car business, or from dealer networks like Penske or AutoNation,” he said. “[Sirvats] has experience in a whole bunch of emerging countries, so I expect he’ll help out in terms in finding people to fill the other two roles in Asia and Europe.”Tesla is expected to begin delivering the highly anticipated Model X \xa0in the third quarter, and eventually Tesla showrooms will need to be updated. Though Tesla will begin filling Model X back orders in the late third quarter, there’s no word yet on when the SUVs will begin appearing in the showrooms.\xa0""We are still on track to begin Model X deliveries in Q3, 2015,"" Tesla spokewoman Alexis Georgeson, said in an email Friday.\xa0""While Model X will be featured in our stores, I can’t yet speak to a date when Tesla will begin displaying them.""']"

The second-quarter number announced Thursday\xa0is higher than the first, which suggests demand for the Model S continues to grow months ahead of the scheduled introduction of the Model X SUV, which is expected to give a boost to sales before the end of the year.The company will need to sell more cars in the second half of the year – about 33,000\xa0units -- to meet its goal, which depends on when customers who have preordered the Model X begin receiving their cars. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has said he expects a small number of Model X deliveries to begin in September, with a considerable ramp-up in the last three months of the year. Any delay to the Model X could cause Tesla to miss its sales goal.Tesla delivered 31,655 cars last year and wants to grow that to 500,000 cars annually, with the help of the Model X luxury electric SUV due out later this year. It\'s an ambitious growth projection that\'s never been accomplished in the automotive industry. Most of that sales volume would come from the $35,000 Model 3 electric sedan that customers should begin receiving in early 2018 if all goes as currently planned.In April, Morgan Stanley autos analyst Adam Jonas, who is bullish on Tesla, said he expected the company to fall short of its 55,000-unit sales target if company management decides the Model X isn’t ready to be released to the public.This year, Telsa Motors began reporting sales number at the end of each quarter instead of in the quarterly reports that come out weeks later. The company’s second-quarter earnings release date has not been announced. Tesla reported its second-quarter 2014 earnings on Aug. 8.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Tesla to report wider losses of $130 million in the quarter ended June 30, from $61.9 million in the same quarter last year.

His statement, posted on Twitter, comes after the popular electric car blog insideevs.com pointed to a recent Tesla presentation claiming the company pushed the Model 3 release from 2017 to 2018. \xa0Contrary to speculative blogger reports, we still plan to show Model 3 in 2016 and begin production in 2017.â€” ricardo reyes (@ricardor) June 22, 2015Vehicle releases dates are a touchy subject for Tesla Motors, because the Palo Alto, California, company isn’t profitable and likely won’t be for years as it sheds billions of dollars to hit an ambitious goal of selling 500,000 electric vehicles annually by 2020. The company recently secured a critical line of credit for up to $750 million to cover day-to-day operations.Tesla is under immense pressure to meet deadlines. The Model X was delayed three times and is now expected out in the first half of next year. According to a June 15 presentation at a conference in Washington, D.C., the Model 3 is “planned for 2018.”    A June 15 Tesla Motors presentation has the Model 3 delivery date ""planned in 2018,"" which some say is a succinct way of saying the Model 3 is delayed. Tesla denied this on Monday.  Photo: Tesla Motors  Insideevs.com says this is essentially a delay from a previously mentioned 2017 release date. The Wall Street Journal said in April the Model 3 was “due” in 2017. But that doesn’t make clear if the Tesla due date is for production or for delivery. Automakers typically announce release dates that imply when cars appear in dealerships. Tesla doesn\'t work with dealerships, so its delivery dates are closer to when cars start rolling off the company\'s Fremont, California, factory line.\xa0“We are hoping to show off the Model 3 in approximately March of next year [2016]. Again, like, don\'t hold me to that month, but that\'s, like – that\'s our aspiration,” Tesla Motors CEO Elon Musk told analysts. “And that\'s – and then be in production with Model 3 in the, I\'d like to say mid, but probably closer to late 2017 time frame. Late 2017 is probably more realistic.”If the Model 3 begins production in December of next year, it will likely see its first deliveries in 2018. Last year, the company said about 1,400 Model S sedans were produced in December and delivered in January because of weather and shipping delays and because some customers weren\'t home during the Christmas break.\xa0The news of the alleged delay hasn’t had much of an impact on the company’s share price. Though Tesla’s stock price was down 0.8 percent to $260.41 on Monday, the shares are up 4 percent since the June 15 presentation and up nearly 12 percent since the May 22 conference call when Musk announced the Model 3 production date.\xa0']"

The Silicon Valley maker of the Model S luxury electric car announced Friday it had secured a lifeline from five major banks.Tesla said in a regulatory filing\xa0it now has access to $500 million to be “used for working capital and general corporate purposes.” The interest on the loans will vary based on when withdrawals of the credit line take place, and the company retains the option of increasing this credit line to $750 million.Deutsche Bank, Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo and Credit Suisse are part of the deal. The interest on the borrowing is floating, which means the costs will increase for loans taken out after the U.S. Fed begins to increase rates, which could happen later this year. Outstanding loans will come due in June 2020, the year Tesla CEO Elon Musk wants to be selling 500,000 electric cars a year, up from 32,655 in 2014.If all goes as Musk plans in the fastest ramp-up of sales in automotive history, the company would be able to pay back these loans. The company currently holds about $2.5 billion in long-term debt, mostly from two corporate bond issues that investors quickly bought in February 2014.“Tesla won’t have any problems raising funds,” Thilo Koslowski, vice president and automotive practice leader at technology research firm Gartner Inc., told International Business Times in a recent interview about whether Apple Inc. would buy Tesla. “There’s plenty of people out there who believe in Musk’s vision.”This is a good thing because Tesla is burning through its cash as it works on the upcoming Model X and Model 3 vehicles, builds a $5 billion battery factory in partnership with Panasonic, and fleshes out its global network of charging stations and retail and service outlets. The company spent $558 million in the first three months of the year, more than the $330 million Morgan Stanley had forecast.Tesla is a growth stock, which means investors are more concerned right now about revenue growth than profitability and are likely to accept losses for the coming years, but only if Tesla can maintain consistent sales growth.']"

Elizabeth and Mark lost their shareholder proposals to phase out leather from future Tesla car options, but not without some supporters.\xa0Original story begins here:After working for months to win six minutes at Tuesday’s Tesla Motors fifth annual shareholder meeting, Elizabeth Farrell Peters and her husband, Mark Peters, asked fellow Tesla Model S owners and company stakeholders to think about whether the electric carmaker should be offering leather as a luxury option. The Peters maintain a vegan household at their Hurst, Texas, home, but their request is more than personal.“Tesla has two choices,” Elizabeth said during her three-minute pitch supporting a measure that would phase leather out of Tesla’s supply chain. “Tesla can continue to fill cars with skins of sentient beings … while adding a massive amount of greenhouse gas to the air. … Or Tesla can adopt many of the faux leather interiors used by Mercedes-Benz, Lexus, Infiniti and others.”Leather has long been a part of the luxury car business, and even the companies that offer alternatives have yet considered eliminating the animal-product option. But the couple said that Tesla should raise the bar considering its environmental mission. Shareholders voted on the proposals. Results will be posted within four business days.\xa0    Mark Peters (pictured) and his wife Elizabeth Farrell Peters, Tesla Model S owners and company shareholders, officially pitched their proposal to get Tesla to stop offering leather interior options.  Photo: Screenshot  The couple offered two shareholder proposals: one in which the company would stop offering leather by 2019 and one in which it would offer cruelty-free synthetic alternatives used by other luxury carmakers that generates as much as 65 percent fewer carbon dioxide emissions.Tesla has recommended shareholders vote against the measures, citing the need to prioritize its objectives. But Tesla CEO Elon Musk hinted Tuesday that the company might consider alternatives.“Yeah, absolutely,” he said. “We’ll look into it.”Mark and Elizabeth Peters\xa0have plenty of data to back up the implications of leather in the automotive industry and elsewhere. A 2006 report from the U.N. Food and Agricultural Organization\xa0estimates livestock farming makes up 18 percent of all greenhouse gas emissions. And the process of leather tanning is a highly toxic process.Since Tesla’s core mission is to reduce the impact of human-caused global warming, the Peterses say the use of leather is antithetical to the company’s forward-thinking mission. “Frankly, it’s un-Tesla,” to use leather in its cars, Mark said.Tesla bundles leather armrests and dashboards in a $3,000 option package that includes the power liftgate, interior accent lighting, fog lights and illuminated door handles. Customers who want any of those items have to get leather trim. Another $3,000 option provides fancier “executive” rear seating, but only in leather. Stephanie Downs, a member of corporate affairs at the nonprofit animal rights group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, stood up during the meeting to back the proposals.“Regardless of anyone\'s dietary preference, the production of leather uses massive amounts of toxic substances,” she told the crowd, referring to the other environmental hazard of curing animal skin, the salts, lime sludge, sulfides, acids and arsenic used to preserve the skins.']"

CEO Elon Musk maintained his company’s target of 55,000 vehicle sales for the year at his company’s fifth annual shareholders meeting in Mountain View, California, on Tuesday. Speaking to crowded hall at the Computer History Museum, Musk also announced Chief Financial Officer Deepak Ahuja, who’s been with the company since 2008, will step down later this year but assist in a “smooth transition” of his as-of-yet unannounced replacement.“It seems like we’ll be able to maintain roughly 50 percent average [sales] growth rate per year for several years to come,” Musk said during his presentation.At that rate, Tesla should deliver 55,000 cars to customers this year and about 82,500 in 2016. Tesla’s sales growth is one of the most important metrics for measuring the company’s progress toward selling 500,000 cars in 2020, the fastest sales ramp-up in automotive history.Musk also said the Model X SUV is on schedule to begin deliveries to customers “in about three or four months.” The company was expected to begin a small number of Model X deliveries to customers before the end of September.Musk also said he would begin selling Tesla cars in Mexico before the end of the year, putting the company’s marketing and sales flag in all three North American countries. \xa0Here are five other major takeaways from Tesla Motors’ shareholder meeting on Tuesday:The Model XMusk said company crash tests show the Model X could become the safest SUV in history. Utility vehicles have had a reputation for rollover risks because of their high centers of gravity. But the Model X architecture places a heavy battery pack beneath the floor, giving the SUV the same low profile as the Model S.“It’s very difficult to get the Model X to roll over,” Musk said. The Model X will use the same dual motor drivetrain as the all-wheel drive Model S.The Model 3Tesla’s planned $35,000 electric car due out in 2017 will utilize a single-motor rear-wheel drive “to keep the car as affordable a possible,” Musk said. A dual-motor all-wheel drive option will be available as a premium add-on.The newer base version of the Model S, the 70D, comes with all-wheel drive from two motors. It’s currently Tesla’s most popular version of the Model S, Musk said. The car went on sale earlier this year.New ‘Supple’ Supercharger CablesTesla Motors operates a network of quick-charging stations that gives its customers complementary electricity. But the charger cables are bulky, something the company has been working to fix. The first thinner liquid-cooled cables were just deployed at a station in Mountain View.“Instead of wrestling a good-size snake into the car, it’s a really supple cord,” said Musk. “It also has the potential of increasing the amount of power that can go through the cable in the future.” This suggests Tesla wants future Supercharger stations to charge up cars faster. Currently it takes about 20 minutes to charge a car to 80 percent capacity.Auto Steering Due By End Of MonthThe Model S currently offers automatic emergency braking and blind spot warnings. Musk said a select few beta testers will get auto steering in their cars by the end of the month. The technology would allow the Model S to automatically steer and shift lanes under highway driving conditions.The current Model S sedans have forward radar and 360-degree ultrasonic scanning ability out to about 16 feet in any direction. Musk says this isn’t enough for fully autonomous driving, but it’s adequate for more advanced driver assistance.What about fully autonomous driving, the kind that lets you go to sleep and wake up at your destination?“From a technical feasibility standpoint, I think it will be technically possible in approximately three years,” Musk said. “It will take some time after that for regulators to accept that it’s OK to just go to sleep in the car.”For that to happen, automakers will have to collect enough data to prove to regulators at state and federal levels -- not to mention foreign governments -- that computers drive better and more safely than humans. That, he says, “will take time.”Will SpaceX Go Public? A shareholder in the audience wanted to know when or if Musk plans to hold an IPO for his space transport company, Space Exploration Technologies (SpaceX).“If you’re talking about something really long term, like building cities on Mars ... I think it would be not super loved by the public markets,” he replied. “SpaceX will go public once we have regular flights to Mars.”Two of Musk’s three companies, solar energy services provider SolarCity and Tesla, are publicly listed. But SpaceX is closest to Musk’s dream of interplanetary human colonization -- and also the most wildly ambitious.']"
https://www.ibtimes.com/mercedes-benz-follows-tesla-motors-home-energy-storage-1959453,Mercedes-Benz Follows Tesla Motors Into Home Energy Storage,Angelo Young,06/09/15,5:33 PM,"['Daimler AG started taking orders Tuesday in Germany for Mercedes-Benz branded battery packs for domestic and commercial energy storage. Tesla Motors CEO Elon Musk recently announced a step in his company’s effort to advance home and industrial energy storage, but the Germans – who long ago took the lead in embracing renewable energy – aren’t sitting idle.The move shows that Tesla won’t be the only automotive industry player in the growing market for domestic energy storage. Mercedes-Benz’s B-Class Electric Drive, the company’s first all-electric car, went on sale in the 2015 model year. But its introduction of domestic and commercial battery storage suggests that, like Tesla, Daimler is hedging its bets on electric car demand by taking its batteries to a disruptive new market that could challenge traditional energy distribution systems.Daimler is now using its electric car batteries to market storage units that can either offer backup power to business or a way for homeowners to harvest solar energy to use during peak-load hours. \xa0The batteries can “compensate for sometimes high fluctuations in consumption and reduce energy costs, said Accumotive, the Daimler subsidiary selling the Mercedes-Benz battery systems. Accumotive says its 2.5 kilowatt hour (kWh) packs can be strung together for up to 20 kWh, which is enough to power a typical U.S. home for about 16 hours, based on data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. But Germans consume less energy than Americans, with the typical household using about 10 kWh a day, according to the World Energy Council. Like Tesla, Accumotive offers larger units as custom configurations.Daimler has yet to disclose the price of the units. Tesla’s Powerwall systems begin at $3,500 excluding installation costs.In 2009, Daimler helped rescue Tesla by purchasing a 9 percent stake in the company for about $50 million. It sold those shares last year, but not before incorporating Tesla’s technology for its B-Class sedan.Watch the video presentation (in German) that Accumotive posted to YouTube on Tuesday.\xa0']"

Shareholders are also keen to hear about the latest developments in the building of the company\'s massive battery factory near Reno, Nevada.\xa0“They’ll probably talk about how sales are looking and the timing of new model launches,” said Thilo Koslowski, vice president and automotive practice leader at technology research firm Gartner Inc. “Any progress on the gigafactory would be welcomed.”Tesla has an important July-September quarter ahead of it. The company will release second-quarter sales data sometime before the Fourth of July weekend, and it is scheduled to begin delivering the Model X before the end of the quarter.""Although sentiment [about Tesla] has improved over the past three months, we still believe there is skepticism surrounding Tesla Energy, the Model X launch, and demand,"" Benjamin Kallo, an analyst for clean technology at Robert W. Baird & Co., wrote in a research note published Monday. ""We think upcoming events will help improve sentiment.” Kallo said last week he saw no indication that demand for the Tesla Model S had peaked.This year’s shareholder meeting will feature a proposal brought forward by Mark Peters and his wife Elizabeth Farrell Peters of Hurst, Texas, who oppose using animal products in Tesla cars. The Peterses will each get three minutes to pitch their proposal to phase out leather and replace it with the high-end synthetic fabrics offered by other luxury carmakers, such as BMW’s SensaTec and Mercedes-Benz’s MB-Tex. \xa0“This is an elephant in the room,” of Musk’s oft-stated mission to reduce greenhouse gases, Mark Peters\xa0told International Business Times\xa0in April. (Livestock is a major emitter global warming emissions.) Tesla opposes the measure citing a need to “prioritize our efforts,” the company said in a regulatory filing announcing details of the annual meeting.Shareholder meetings rarely produce any significant market moving revelations, largely because doing so could violate regulatory rules. But during last year’s Tesla annual meeting Musk hinted he would make a big announcement on patents just days before the company said it would allow anyone to use its patents for free “in the spirit of the open source movement.” Musk also said at last year’s meeting the Model 3 would look similar to the Model X and could come with autopilot, and the Model X door would have proximity sensors to avoid dings. Musk also predicted Tesla would sell 40,000 last year, but the company ended up falling short by more than 8,000 cars.An important issue Musk might address is where the company plans to acquire more capital. Tesla was down to about $1.5 billion as of the end of March and will need to acquire more funding to reach its goal of selling 500,000 cars a year by 2020.Watch Telsa’s 2014 shareholder meeting here:']"

But analysts point out that the number is a ballpark figure based on state vehicle registrations that\xa0shouldn’t be used to measure how well the company is achieving its goal of selling 55,000 cars worldwide this year.Meeting sales targets is vital to the company’s goal of delivering 500,000 vehicles per year by 2020, up from 31,655 last year. If Tesla succeeds, it would be the fastest ramp-up in automotive history, and both boosters and naysayers are closely tracking sales numbers to measure this progress.“It’s good to see growth in the U.S. on a year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter basis, but I would caution against using estimates like this,” said Benjamin Kallo, an analyst for clean technology at Robert W. Baird & Co. “Accuracy is not 100 percent, and we’ve seen third party services get way off on some of their estimates. You have to take all of this with a grain of salt.”The WardsAuto estimate released Tuesday says Tesla sold 1,652 Model S cars in May, up from 1,100 in the same month last year and 1,377 in April. That puts the number of U.S. Model S sales in the first two months of the current April-June quarter at 3,029. Unlike other automakers, Tesla doesn't report monthly sales, so all monthly estimates are unconfirmed by the company.\xa0Earlier this year, the automaker began reporting quarterly sales at the end of each quarter in order to avoid the speculation that often took place between the end of the quarter and the release of the number in the earnings statement weeks later. The next official Tesla sales figure will be out at the end of June.\xa0Tesla sold 10,030 Model S cars globally in its first quarter, including 1,400 units whose deliveries were delayed due to the weather and because customers were on vacation, according to the company. This means Tesla needs to average 14,990 global unit sales per quarter for the rest of the year to meet its annual target. If the WardsAuto figures for U.S. sales are accurate, Tesla will unlikely hit 14,990 unit sales in the current quarter. The U.S. is Tesla’s largest market and makes up the biggest portion Model S sales.Tesla has said it would sell more cars toward the end of the year than at the beginning, especially after the planned rollout of the highly anticipated Model X crossover SUV, so it doesn’t need to hit the 14,990 number in the second quarter -- it can make up for that in the second half of the year. But Tesla will need to sell more cars in the April-June quarter than it did in the first three months of the year (10,030 units) to avoid any speculation of falling demand.\xa0“From what we can tell demand is very solid,” Kallo said.Tesla shares were trading up a slight 0.29 percent to $249.07 on Wednesday.

Though he stopped short of addressing his company’s rumored work in developing an electric vehicle, the comments reignited speculation that Apple is taking its future in the automotive world seriously.“The car is the ultimate mobile device, isn’t it?” Williams told an audience at the Re/code conference in Rancho Palo Verdes, California, a gathering of tech and media leaders.Williams was answering a question from the audience about what the company could do with its $193.54 billion in cash besides the stock buybacks and dividends that some shareholders are demanding, including noted investor activist Carl Icahn.When pressed on the car topic, Williams steered the conversation toward Apple CarPlay, which integrates the iPhone into a vehicle’s dashboard computer. Automakers are starting to release vehicles that are compatible with both CarPlay and Google’s Android Auto, and clearly this has been high on Apple’s automotive agenda in recent years.In March, Apple CEO Tim Cook dodged questions about whether Apple would acquire Tesla Motors, the Silicon Valley maker of the Model S luxury electric car. In one way, the move makes sense because Tesla’s engineers headed by futurist CEO Elon Musk have done much of what a tech company would need to do to start making cars. And Tesla is burning through cash so quickly it will need more capital soon. Telsa had $1.51 billion in cash at the end of March, down from $1.91 billion at the end of 2014. A few billion dollars from Apple’s cash hoard would go a long way.“That Tesla still requires more capital shows you that automotive is a very resource-intensive business,” said Thilo Koslowski, vice president and automotive practice leader at technology research firm Gartner Inc. “But I don’t think Apple wants to be a bank. Any partnership with Tesla would have to go well beyond that.”Indeed, the relationship would be complicated.Musk isn’t likely to cede control of Tesla, so any investment in his company would have to secure his position. And that could be a deal breaker for a company like Apple, which prefers to be in complete control of what it produces.Apple has never said publicly that it wants to make cars, but it also hasn’t denied reports, citing anonymous insiders, that it’s working at a secretive facility in Cupertino to produce an electric car by 2020. \xa0Automakers are starting to release vehicles that are compatible with both CarPlay and Google’s Android Auto. At the same event on Wednesday, General Motors CEO Mary Barra announced that CarPlay and Android Auto will appear in 14 Chevrolet cars in 2016, including the $13,000 Chevy Spark mini.Tesla Motors Inc.

Tesla has been challenging dealers in many states who say manufacturers should stick to the traditional franchise dealership model.Currently, 25 states prohibit Tesla from selling its cars through its own boutique stores.The Maryland law, specifically crafted for Tesla, allows “a manufacturer or distributor to be licensed as a vehicle dealer if the manufacturer or distributor deals only in electric or nonfossil-fuel burning vehicles.” It was approved by the state’s Legislature last month.

The company has held firm against using franchised dealers because, much like Apple Inc., Tesla wants control over its retail channels.The company uses small boutiques, often nestled in malls, rather than conventional dealerships. In states where it cannot sell directly to consumers, including Texas, Louisiana, Michigan and Maine, Tesla operates what it calls “galleries” instead of “stores.” Customers can browse catalogues and kick the tires of a Model S in a Tesla gallery, but they cannot perform test drives or pick up their new cars from them.

Tesla shares rose 2.76 percent, or $6.37, to close at $236.80 on Thursday.\xa0Investors digested news reported late Wednesday by the Detroit Free Press that Tesla Motors reached a deal to acquire Riviera Tool LLC (OTCMKTS:RIVT), a small penny-stock listed metal-stamping facility based in Grand Rapids, Michigan. The newspaper said the company would become Tesla Tool & Die. This is the first acquisition of another company for Tesla and its first foray into the Detroit 3’s Michigan stronghold. The price of the deal has not been disclosed.Tesla Motors Inc. (Nasdaq:TSLA) shares started the day down nearly 3 percent from the previous day’s close after Morgan Stanley said the company was burning through cash at an “eye-watering rate” and that the company would exhaust its current $1.5 billion cash pile in about three quarters without more money.A spokeswoman for Riviera Tool wouldn’t comment on the deal Thursday afternoon but referred all inquiries to Tesla Motors. Riviera makes die systems for rapid production of automobile structural components, such as hoods, doors, roofs, fenders and bumpers.Tesla appears to be taking a cue from Silicon Valley tech companies that acquire small firms to become exclusive components suppliers. The maker of the Model S luxury electric car must secure a reliable stream of parts to support its ambitious growth plan, which includes ramping up production of the Model X SUV beginning in the third quarter in order to double automotive production by the fourth quarter, if not sooner.“There are a lot of execution risks coming in the second half of the year,” said Theodore O’Neill, senior research consultant of Ascendiant Capital Markets. “Sixty percent of their production this year is going to take place in the second half, with a lot of that happening in the fourth quarter. If one screw doesn’t show up in time, they could miss their [production and delivery] targets.”Tesla is under immense pressure to meet production, delivery and revenue-growth benchmarks, because it’s not expected to turn a profit until after 2020. In a shareholder letter issued Wednesday, CEO Elon Musk and Chief Financial Officer Deepak Ahuja said their company made 11,160 cars in the first quarter, and delivered 10,045 Model S cars to customers in the three months ending March 31.In the current quarter, Tesla is aiming to produce 12,500 vehicles and deliver between 10,000 and 11,000 cars to customers. This means in order to reach the “approximately 55,000” deliveries in 2014, it would need to sell about 17,000 cars per quarter in the last half of the year.Tesla wants to double vehicle production, from about 1,000 cars a week to 2,000 toward the end of the year.

The reason: solar energy incentives. \xa0Musk was responding to a question from an analyst during the company’s first-quarter conference call about reports SolarCity, the rooftop-solar-panel company Musk chairs, isn’t ready to offer the 7 kilowatt hours Powerwall battery pack, designed for daily home use because it doesn’t make financial sense.“It’s true, in the U.S., with rare exceptions, it’s more expensive than utility,” he said. For Europe and other markets that don’t use net metering, like Germany and Australia, the company claims the batteries make economic sense.\xa0The main reason why the battery system doesn’t make economic sense is because it charges the battery with energy that homeowners with solar systems would otherwise be credited for under a system called net metering. The 10 kilowatt-hour Powerwall battery pack is designed to cycle weekly as an energy backup system for when the power grid fails, which means it charges less frequently and suffers less from net metering credits.Despite the cost inefficiencies, Musk said Wednesday the demand for its energy storage units will exceed supply until the company’s “gigafactory” battery plant begins limited operations early next year. “The response has been overwhelming, like crazy,” Musk said. “In a course of less than a week, we’ve had 38,000 reservations for the Powerwall and 28,000 for the Powerpack [the larger battery for businesses and utilities].”']"

Spurred in part by the drop-off, companies installed panels on nearly 200,000 homes and businesses in 2014, bringing the total count to more than 600,000 nationwide, solar industry data show.SolarCity said it added 153 megawatts in solar power capacity in the first quarter, above its projections of 145 MW. Residential installations under contract reached a record 237 MW, up 74 percent for the period. The company expects to install up to 1,000 MW in new solar capacity for the year, compared with 502 MW for all of 2014.The company had projected a loss of up to $1.75 a share on revenue of up to $60 million.

The financial report and follow-up conference call with CEO Elon Musk will offer the latest snapshot of the company’s main business: making and selling luxury electric cars.“Heading into the earnings call, we continue to look for more details surrounding Model X execution -- in particular, launch timing, speed of ramp and order back log,” Morgan Stanley said in an April 14 research note, underscoring the importance of Tesla’s upcoming electric crossover SUV.Shareholders will ignore profit losses in the report so long as the company hits revenue targets for the first three months of the year, and they will look to see whether Model X is progressing. A small number of deliveries are expected out in the July-September quarter, with as many as 3,000 Model X deliveries in the last three months of the year.Tesla Motors' (Nasdaq:TSLA) share price closed up nearly 2 percent to $230.51 on Monday after Credit Suisse analysts issued a bullish research note on how its venture into energy storage systems will work seamlessly with the company’s electric car ambitions.Here are five important issues to look for in Musk’s letter to shareholders, Tesla’s earnings statement and the conference call.1. Did Tesla deliver expected earnings numbers? Tesla is forecast to report first-quarter revenue of $1.04 billion, up from $620.5 million last year, according to Monday’s analysts forecast from Thomson Reuters. Net loss is seen widening to $115.1 million, from a loss of $49.8 million in the year-ago period. Fully reported per-share losses are expected to widen to 89 cents, from a loss of 40 cents last year. Nobody expects Tesla to be profitable anytime soon, but if Tesla misses on revenue, the stock will take a hit. If it beats, the bulls will rally as long as there isn’t bad news tucked elsewhere in the earnings.2. Will Tesla provide new guidance on sales? The company changed the way it reports sales numbers, so we already know that in the first quarter the company delivered 10,030 vehicles to its customers, including 1,400 Model S cars whose deliveries were delayed because of weather and customers on vacation. This means deliveries were lifted in the quarter. Tesla says it can deliver 55,000 vehicles this year, or almost 15,000 cars per quarter for the rest of the year. Some analysts are already adjusting the number down. Tesla could either maintain this 55,000-vehicle goal, which would be good news, or lower it, which would be bad.3. Tesla’s mounting debt. Absolutely vital to the company’s progress is how it will continue to finance operations. “Servicing our convertible senior notes requires a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial debt,” the company said in its 2014 annual report. Tesla ended 2014 with three convertible notes (corporate bonds that can be converted into stock at a later date) totaling $3.12 billion. Tesla CFO Deepak Ahuja will likely be asked about the company’s efforts to raise more money for ongoing efforts, including fully financing the $5 billion “gigafactory” battery manufacturing plant it’s building east of Reno, Nevada, and the expansion of its global marketing, servicing and battery-charging networks. Cash flow is increasingly a problem for the car company, and it will need to explain its financing plans.4. How will pre-owned Tesla Model S cars impact Tesla revenue? Tesla began selling certified pre-owned Model S cars on its website last week. Expect Musk or Ahuja to discuss the company's expectations for the nascent new business. The price of used Model S cars is an important issue for Tesla, which offers customers a buyback-price guarantee for cars leased through the company’s own financing division. Future obligations will be determined by how much customers will pay for used Model S cars.5. How will Tesla’s home, business and microgrid energy storage systems affect the company’s core business? Following Tesla’s announcement last week, investors and analysts will want to know how the battery business will intersect with the car business. On Monday, Credit Suisse analysts were bullish that the energy storage system will work seamlessly with the company’s car business. “Over time, we expect the market will recognize that battery-system engineering is a core competency of Tesla's and we see development of what seems to be a cutting edge energy storage battery as a further proof-point,” said the Credit Suisse research note.""]"

Dubbed, “Tesla Energy,” the latest battery system is predicted to help wean consumers away from oil and gas.The new battery unit is divided into two separate products -- the “Powerwall,” a home battery system, and the “Powerpack,” which is meant for businesses, industrial applications and public utility companies. The latest move by Tesla is considered to be the company’s attempt to become a major player in the growing microgrid industry, which is expected to change the way power is consumed across the world.“Our goal is to fundamentally change the way the world uses energy on an extreme scale. The goal is complete transformation of the energy infrastructure of the world,” Reuters quoted Tesla CEO Elon Musk as saying at the company’s design studio at Hawthorne, California, on Thursday.Tesla said that SolarCity Corp, run by Musk\'s cousin Lyndon Rive, would be its lead installation partner for home battery, but there would be many other companies to join hands with Tesla in the project, Reuters reported.The Powerwall, a rechargeable lithium-ion battery, comes in a 10 kWh version for $3,500 and a 7 kWh version for $3,000. The unit, which features an integrated heat management system, measures about three feet by four feet in size and is six inches thick. The battery can store extra solar energy, which can be used when the sun goes down.    Construction of the Tesla Gigafactory outside Reno, Nevada is shown Feb. 18, 2015. Photo: Reuters/James Glover II  The Powerwall is expected to go on sale later this year in the United States, followed by foreign markets, USA Today reported, adding that the production of the batteries will take place in the Tesla “Gigafactory,” which is built on the outskirts of Reno, Nevada.The ""Powerpack"" is described by Tesla as an “infinitely scalable system,” which comes in 100 kWh battery blocks that can scale from 500 kWh to 10 MWh and higher. According to Musk, 60 million Powerpack units will be able to power the entire U.S. while 2 billion will be enough to power the world, The Verge reported.“With Tesla Energy, Tesla is amplifying its efforts to accelerate the move away from fossil fuels to a sustainable energy future with Tesla batteries, enabling homes, business, and utilities to store sustainable and renewable energy to manage power demand, provide backup power and increase grid resilience,” the company said in a statement.']"

Quietly announced earlier this month, this small $1.5 million electrical grid provides power to an office park operated by Oncor, one of the nation’s largest electricity distributors.This small 1.25-megawatt system was installed to fix persistent power-outage problems in this remote area outside Dallas, but not without two large battery storage units manufactured by Tesla Motors.“This is a fully functioning system of buildings and local generation that when combined with an energy storage system, can disconnect and still provide enough power to run critical applications,” said Troy Miller, manager of business development for power quality systems at S&C Electric, which helped develop the microgrid with Oncor and Schneider Electric.On Thursday evening in Hawthorne, California, Tesla will announce the latest effort in its bid to become more than a maker of luxury electric cars. It aspires to become a major player in the small but growing microgrid industry that could radically upend the way power is collected and distributed. Utilities could increasingly find themselves cut out of the loop, and a future electricity wholesale market could see independent energy farmers selling their harvests to each other.The maker of the sleek Model S electric car has been supplying residential and commercial battery systems for a while in California, but its emphasis on larger energy storage units suggests the company has much higher ambitions. With a major battery factory in the works outside Reno, Nevada, Tesla and its partner Panasonic hope to lower the price of high-energy lithium-ion cells in the coming years, thus clearing a major hurdle toward wider adoption of microgrids: the cost. Miller estimates that batteries still account for about half of the cost of energy storage systems used in power applications. But that’s changing fast.A\xa0Nature Climate Change\xa0analysis of 85 cost estimates -- from researchers, consultants and industry -- says that the cost of batteries used in electric cars has dropped from $1,000 per kilowatt-hour in 2007 to $410 last year. Tesla’s costs are estimated to be lower, at around $300 per kwh. The company projects that getting the gigafactory up and running will shave 30 percent off the cost of its batteries.Jesse Morris, head of energy and transportation issues at the Rocky Mountain Institute, which advocates for sustainable development, says lithium-ion batteries are better at transferring high amounts of energy quickly. This makes them ideal for so-called demand-charge reduction, using battery power during peak hours when the cost of electricity increases.“It would be unique if Tesla deploys these lithium-ion batteries at a utility scale,” Morris said. “For Tesla to come out and say with the help of the gigafactory, ‘We’re going to be able to meet or beat the costs of those other battery chemistries\' -- that’s a big deal.”Morris says Tesla wants to put itself increasingly “behind the power meters” at both residential and larger scales, meeting the power storage needs of both solar-connected homes and research centers like Oncor’s. Coming out strong on developing its battery technology in this new but nascent power distribution system, fueled by lower energy storage costs, would give Tesla a new source of revenue as demand for its storage units increases.Miller of S&C Electric said he’s noticing more demand for localized power operations.“In the past, our primary demand has been for larger, megawatt-sized systems for grid applications,"" he said, ""but\xa0recently we have begun seeing increasing demand for smaller energy storage systems for microgrids.”Here’s a video outlining how Oncor’s microgrid works:']"

So last year,\xa0he\xa0bought a Tesla Model S and launched Drivr, a Cincinnati-based limousine-hailing service. The fleet has since grown to four cars, with more on the way. And Seitz is now planning his next outpost in Denver.Seitz’s “exclusively Tesla” company offers rides at a price comparable to Uber’s recently introduced UberSelect luxury car service because, he says, using electric cars is more cost-effective.“The economics help us keep the price low,” Seitz said. “There’s almost no fuel and maintenance costs that are associated with regular cars.”Seitz is one of a growing number of entrepreneurs betting that Tesla’s high-tech, WiFi-enabled electric car is an obvious choice for commercial limousine transport.A 20-hour flight away from Ohio, in Wuhan, China, the Wuhan Tri-Ring taxi company just reportedly placed an order for a fleet of 100 Model S sedans to use as a premium taxi service in the city of 10 million people. The company already had 10 Tesla taxis that give rides for a higher fee than conventional gas-burners, according to the China’s Sina Online. The rest of the cars are expected to be deployed by September.The Chinese purchase is Tesla’s second-largest known fleet order after the Dutch government-owned Schiphol Group bought 167 Model S sedans to carry passengers to and from Amsterdam’s Schiphol Airport. That fleet, managed by two taxi companies, went live in October. Tesla doesn’t actively pursue bulk orders (known in the industry as fleet sales) because it wouldn’t be able to handle them without extending delivery delays to current U.S. customers.Norway was the first country outside of the U.S. to use Tesla cars as taxis in 2014. Thanks to the country’s generous electric car incentives and high luxury car taxes, the Model S costs less than comparable gasoline-burning cars, like the Porsche Panamera, and taxi passengers in Oslo are more likely than anywhere else to wind up in the back of a Model S. \xa0\xa0The cars are suited for urban commercial transportation because their range is higher than many average daily routes for conventional taxis. The New York City Taxi & Limousine Commission estimates that a typical yellow cab adds 70,000 miles to its odometer every year, or about 192 miles a day.The Tesla Model S with the 85 kWh battery can travel 270 miles per charge, comfortably inside the distance a New York City taxi would travel on a typical day. And unlike urban apartment dwellers who can’t easily plug in privately owned electric cars, fleet owners can juice up their electric rides at a central location where the cars are parked when they’re not in use. One concern is traffic, especially in crowded cities. A Tesla Model S limo in a big city would give up a chunk of its range waiting to move forward.\xa0Tesla Motors doesn’t itemized sales figures, so it’s difficult to know how many Model S cars are being used commercially. But interest is growing in offering the cars as limos, as California’s Strack Transportation started doing in 2013. And last month, Oregon’s Portland City Council approved an application for an electric-car taxi company. According to Oregon Public Broadcasting, EcoCab will start service in the city with 15 electric cars. Company owner Ron Knori says most of them will be Model S sedans.Drivr’s founder Seitz says so far his customers have not been just business travelers -- the kind of customers China’s Wuhan Tri-Ring targets.“The demographics are all over the place, from 25 [years old] to 65,” he said. \xa0“You also have elderly people who want to get around. The cars have room for their wheelchairs.”""]"

But two activist shareholders are calling on company investors to demand Tesla phase out leather interior options, pointing to the global-warming emissions caused by livestock farming. They want the Palo Alto-based maker of the Model S luxury electric car to use instead synthetic alternatives like the ones offered by Mercedes-Benz and Lexus.“Reducing these emissions is at its core and they’re doing incredible work creating this huge sustainable energy industry. But the biggest problem with greenhouse gas is from livestock, not transport,” said Tesla shareholder Mark Peters.Peters, an airline pilot, and his wife, Elizabeth, a yoga instructor and dental hygienist, are expected to travel to Mountain View, California, to attend Tesla’s annual shareholder meeting June 9, which was announced by the company Wednesday. The couple from the Fort Worth suburb of Hurst, Texas, became so enamored by the Model S that they bought shares in the company, which afforded them the right to lobby for their proposal to appear on the company’s annual proxy statement -- a document that allows shareholders to make informed decisions on issues that are brought up at a company’s annual meeting.These votes typically involve appointments to boards of directors, matters regarding executive compensation packages or, in this case, a proposal to remove animal-sourced products from Tesla’s supply chain.“We spent a lot of time doing this shareholder resolution, many, many hours\xa0over many days, which turned into months,” Peters said.    In one of the most famous TV car commercials in history, actor Ricardo Montalbán purrs: ""I request nothing beyond the thickly cushioned luxury seats available even in soft Corinthian leather."" It was the 70s, and leather seats were a way to lure customers to ""luxury"" American cars like the Chrysler Cordoba. ""Corinthian"" was a marketing term; the leather was supplied mostly from New Jersey, not Corinth, Greece. Today, leather is still a status symbol even though (pricier) synthetic equivalents are available as luxury car options.  Elizabeth and Mark will be given three minutes apiece during the annual meeting to sell their idea to remove leather from all new Tesla cars by 2019, and for Tesla to become the first “cruelty-free, premium brand” in the automotive industry. Mark admits success is a long shot. Even if it were a binding vote, shareholders typically support the recommendations from the board. Tesla leaned against the proposal in the proxy statement filed Wednesday, advising shareholders to vote against it.\xa0“Tesla’s mission when it was created more than a decade ago was the same as it is today:\xa0to accelerate the advent of sustainable transport by bringing compelling and increasingly affordable electric cars to market,” the company said in its proxy statement. “Achieving this mission requires that we prioritize our efforts.\xa0In some cases, this means using existing materials to meet consumer expectations, where exploring alternatives would impede or delay us.”Still, Mark said he hoped the measure would be embraced by the company’s stakeholders, or at least help raise awareness of the issue. A 2006 report from the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations said livestock farming makes up 18 percent of all greenhouse gas emissions. \xa0“This is an elephant in the room,” Mark said\xa0about Tesla’s anti-emission mission. He said Tesla could easily adopt synthetic soft-touch materials, like MB-Tex used by Mercedes-Benz or the NuLuxe material that garnishes Lexus vehicles. These synthetics have received high marks for their quality, but cost more than treated and tanned cow skin.Leather has been used in automobiles for about as long as motorized transport has existed. But since the wide adoption of synthetic fibers, leather had evolved into a premium option that invokes earthy, luxury tastes. In the 1970s, Chrysler famously recruited actor Ricardo Montalbán\xa0to sell its Cordoba sedan’s “soft Corinthian leather.” Today, Tesla offers leather trim and seats in two $3,000 option packages.Tesla shareholders will also decide June 9 whether to authorize PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as Tesla’s independent registered public accounting firm for the year and will also decide whether or not to re-elect Antonio J. Gracias and Kimball Musk (Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s brother) to the company’s board of directors.\xa0']"

Instead, the Model S luxury electric car maker says it will unveil home and utility scale batteries, according to an email sent to investors and analysts Tuesday.On April 30, “we will introduce the Tesla home battery and a very large utility scale battery,” Jeff Evanson, Tesla’s investor relations spokesman, said in an email to analysts. “We will explain the advantages of our solutions and why past battery options were not compelling (okay Elon said ‘sucked’).”“Sorry, no motorcycle ... but that was a creative guess,” Evanson added.Tesla also said Wednesday it will release its financial results for the first quarter ended March 31 on Wednesday, May 6, after markets close in New York. The earnings release will be followed by a conference call with CEO Musk starting at 5:30 p.m. EDT. The live audio webcast can be heard here.The company previously had announced it was working on a battery for home energy storage, but next week’s event, at Tesla's facility in Hawthorne, California, will offer more details about its efforts to grow its energy storage business. The company already provides home storage units for SolarCity Corp. (NASDAQ:SCTY), the solar energy services provider headed by Musk.“We are going to unveil the Tesla home battery, the consumer battery that would be for use in people’s houses or businesses fairly soon,” Musk said in a conference call in February.Tesla Motors Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares jumped 4.43 percent to $218.74 Wednesday morning following the announcement. SolarCity’s stock rose 2.44 percent to $59.10.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Tesla to report 46 percent growth in revenue, to $1.04 billion, compared with the $713 million posted in the first three months of 2014. This could be Tesla’s first billion-dollar quarter for sales.But losses are widening as the company invests heavily in fleshing out its global sales, marketing and service network, as well as the massive battery factory it’s building in Nevada under partnership with its battery supplier, Panasonic Corporation (TYO:6752).Net losses are expected to widen from $49.8 million to $113.1 million, including one-time charges. Per-share losses will grow from 40 cents to 88 cents, including charges. Tesla had about $1.9 billion in cash and debt and other liabilities of about $4.9 billion at the end of 2014.""]"

Morgan Stanley automotive analyst Adam Jonas\xa0cited concerns about the timing of the Tesla Model X SUV launch and Tesla’s ability to rapidly build up the car’s inventory and fill back orders before Dec. 31. Tesla watchers will look to CEO Elon Musk to address these and other questions following the company’s first-quarter earnings results due in early May.""Heading into the earnings call, we continue to look for more details surrounding Model X execution -- in particular, launch timing, speed of ramp [up] and order backlog,"" Jonas said in a research note Tuesday. ""Given the significance of this launch, we don\'t expect Tesla to cut any corners and believe Elon Musk and management are fully willing to sacrifice short-term profitability [via higher-than-expected up-front costs] to ensure a successful debut.""Morgan Stanley maintains an overweight rating for Tesla, which means it expects the stock to outperform the industry, with a 2015 target price of $280.\xa0Tesla\'s shares (NASDAQ:TSLA) dropped 1.11 percent to $207.44 in Tuesday\'s afternoon trading.As a growth stock company investing heavily in expanding global production, sales and support, Tesla Motors doesn’t need to show a profit anytime soon. But one of the most important measurements of the company’s ability to reach its target of 500,000 vehicle sales by 2020 is the growth in deliveries over time. If Tesla misses a target, investors start to worry.The Palo Alto, California, maker of the Model S luxury electric car said in a regulatory filing April 3 that\xa0it delivered 10,030 Model S sedans to customers in the first three months of the year. But that number included 1,400 vehicles that were supposed to be delivered in December but were delayed by “customers being on vacation, severe winter weather and shipping problems [with actual ships],” the company said in a February letter to shareholders.The unforeseen delay means Tesla was able to count those cars in the first quarter, and analysts cheered that the company had exceeded prior forecasts for first quarter deliveries, pushing Tesla’s stock price higher. The company’s share price is up nearly 8 percent since the delivery number was released earlier this month.For Tesla to meet its 2015 guidance of 55,000 cars, it will need to deliver an average of nearly 15,000 cars per quarter through Dec. 31, not a little over 10,000 including some layovers from last year. During a company conference call in February, Musk said he was “pretty comfortable with achieving on deliveries.”But Jonas said he expects Tesla to come in this year at 51,000 vehicle deliveries, including 3,100 Model X SUVs, most of them in the last three months of the year. Last year Tesla downgraded its annual deliveries from 35,000 units to 33,000, citing a temporary halt in production\xa0to add capacity to its sole Fremont, California, factory. It could announce a similar adjustment later this year, especially if the Model X release is delayed for a third time.Tesla wound up delivering 31,655 units last year, up from 6,892 cars in 2013, news that knocked more than 6 percent off the company’s share price on the day the number was announced.Tesla will report financial results of its first quarter ended March 31 after markets close on or near May 7. Tesla will likely announce the definitive date by early next week. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Tesla’s losses to grow to $113.4 million, from a loss of $49.8 million in the same quarter last year. Revenue is expected to ring in at $1.03 billion, up from $713.1 million. Tesla could report its first billion-dollar quarter in revenue terms if it meets this forecast.']"

The vehicle is equipped with more range and features than the one it replaces. The move comes as the electric-car maker aims for a steep increase in 2015 sales, which it hopes to attain in part through the introduction of a sport-utility vehicle,\xa0the Model X, later this year.The new base model is called the 70D, named after the 70 kilowatt hour (kWh) battery pack that gives the new entry-level Model S 240 miles per charge, up from the 208 miles in the previous 60D version.The 70D also gets the standard all-wheel drive that was introduced in the 85-kWh and high-performance versions of the critically acclaimed luxury electric car. The extra juice give the car a blazing 514 horsepower, replacing the 60D\'s 380 hp. That\'s almost the same muscle as a Porsche 911 Turbo at half the price. The new entry-level Model S costs $75,000 excluding shipping costs, about $4,000 more than the version it replaces. It\'s eligible for federal and state green-car incentives.Tesla is hoping to kick-start sales of its lowest-priced Model S. The car has seen lackluster demand as wealthy buyers opt for the 270-mile-range 85 kWh Model S, which starts at $85,000.The Fremont, California, automaker has said it plans to deliver 55,000 cars this year, a 74 percent jump from the 31,655 vehicles it delivered to customers last year. This is part of the company’s ambitious effort to reach annual sales of 500,000 cars by 2020, mostly from sales of a $35,000 Model 3 due out in 2017. The introduction of the Model X SUV should boost sales starting in the latter half of the year.""While extended battery range and added all-wheel drive are important for the base Tesla model, the reality is the vehicle appeals to the wealthiest of the American population due to its price point,"" said\xa0Akshay Anand, auto analyst at vehicle valuation and automotive research comapny Kelley Blue Book. ""The Model X debut may also cause potential 70D or Model S shoppers to wait around a bit and see which vehicle they like more.""Tesla said Friday it delivered 10,030 cars\xa0worldwide in the first three months of the year, including about 1,400 cars whose deliveries were delayed until the start of the year, giving the company nearly a fifth of its 2015 delivery goal. Tesla needs to average about 15,000 cars per quarter for the rest of the year to hit its target.Sales performance is vital to the company right now. Tesla is a growth stock, which means investors are buying shares based on the company meeting certain benchmarks, such as gross margin, progress in the construction of a battery factory in Nevada, and, most crucially, growing demand for its products.The announcement of the new entry-level Model S sent Tesla’s stock price up 2.14 percent to $207.61 in Wednesday morning Nasdaq trading. Shares are up more than 8 percent since the start of the week after investors piled into the stock following Friday’s first-quarter sales announcement.Tesla has started to report three-month unit sales at the end of every quarter instead of including the data in its financial earnings reports, which come out more than a month after the end of every quarter. This gives investors an early view of the company’s quarterly deliveries, but it still means Tesla only discloses sales numbers four times a year.Other automakers release monthly sales data, giving their investors a closer view of how well cars are selling. Tesla also doesn’t disclose regional sales data, making it difficult to gauge global sales performance.']"

(TSLA) said it delivered a record number of Model S luxury electric cars in the first three months of the year, investors have added 6.41 percent to the company’s share price. But the record first quarter deliveries\xa0includes 1,400 cars that were delayed in December due to unforeseen circumstances.On Friday, Tesla said it delivered 10,030 cars to its customers in the first three months of the year, a 55 percent increase from the same period last year. But 1,400 of those deliveries could have taken place in December, according to a Feb. 11 letter to shareholders.“Delivering those cars was physically impossible due to a combination of customers being on vacation, severe winter weather and shipping problems (with actual ships),” the letter signed by CEO Elon Musk and Chief Financial Officer Deepak Ahuja said.This means Tesla delivered Model S cars in the first quarter of the year that could have taken place in the last three months of 2014 were it not for the unforeseen circumstances that prevented the shipments.\xa0Auto delivery numbers are important to automakers and their shareholders because demand for a company’s cars is key to deciding whether to buy or sell a stock in the manufacturer. Falling sales typically mean demand for a car is waning, but deliveries can also decline over a given month when a manufacturer is struggling to make enough cars and deliver them to customers or dealerships. Musk and other company leaders have said numerous times they\'re struggling with production limitations rather than falling demand for their critically acclaimed electric car. \xa0The auto \xa0industry has long played with monthly delivery numbers, especially toward the end of the year as companies race to hit new highs. Because Tesla was hit with those unforeseen delivery problems at the end of 2014, it was able to report quarter-to-quarter growth, giving it a good launch into 2015. The company wants to deliver at least 55,000 cars in 2015, up from 31,655 last year. It now has 10,030 on the books for 2015.\xa0“There is a lot of playing with numbers in the industry, especially at the end of the year,” said Jessica Caldwell, senior automotive analyst for Edmunds.com. “Automakers typically make deliveries to dealerships, and the sales are to the dealers not to the customers. But in Tesla’s case it owns all of its stores.”Tesla doesn’t have a network of franchised dealers it can convince to buy more of its cars in a given month, so it can’t engage in channel stuffing\xa0— a tactic automakers employ when they want to inflate their numbers by enticing dealers to overstock. This is typically done by offering vendors special financing discounts for larger orders, or access to limited supplies of more popular models in return for larger orders of over-produced cars.\xa0Tesla only reports auto sales four times a year, compared to monthly delivery numbers released by other automakers, which makes Tesla’s critical month-to-month performance difficult to gauge and leaves investors and the media to speculate on how many cars the company actually sells within each quarter.\xa0But Caldwell says Tesla isn’t the only company that’s fine with the common misunderstanding of the relationship between delivering a car and selling one.“In fact, it seems like they’re being more upfront about it by explaining what happened,” she said.Tesla did not return a request for comment. The Fremont, California, automaker has not yet announced a date for the release of its first-quarter earnings results, but the report is expected to be released on or near May 7 after markets close.\xa0NOTE: The original version of the story said 1,400 Model S cars were ""booked"" as sales in December and that the media widely reported incorrectly that sales hit a record in the first quarter. \xa0In fact, the delivery of the cars were delayed into the first quarter of 2015 ""due to a combination of customers being on vacation, severe winter weather and shipping problems (with actual ships)."" The sales were booked in the first quarter, not December, making the first quarter a record for sales because Tesla counts a sale at the time a customer receives the car.']"

(NASDAQ:TSLA) stock jumped more than 6 percent Monday on its first day of trading after a surprise Good Friday release of its first-quarter vehicle sales figures. The company reported a 55 percent increase in deliveries for the three-month period ending in March.The release came weeks ahead of the company's financial statement for the January-March quarter. The\xa0move is an attempt to prevent investors from wildly speculating about its sales. Unlike the rest of the industry, Tesla doesn't report monthly sales, and the change isn't likely to curb speculation because it still means sales will be reported four times a year instead of the standard 12.\xa0“Going forward, Tesla will\xa0publish the number of new car deliveries within three days of quarter end,” the company said in a filing with regulators on Friday. “We have decided to take this approach because inaccurate sources of information are sometimes used by others to project the number of vehicle deliveries.”Tesla’s sales growth is vital to the company’s plan to sell 500,000 cars a year by 2020, up from 31,655 last year. Instead of waiting for the company’s first-quarter earnings report, due out in early May (the specific date hasn’t been announced yet), it unveiled its sales numbers on Friday. The release showed deliveries of 10,030 cars in the first three months of this year,\xa0compared with 6,457 in the same period a year ago.CEO Elon Musk said in a November conference that his company doesn’t report monthly sales numbers like other automakers:“Part of the reason why we don't release the monthly deliveries number is just because it varies quite a lot by region and then the media tends to read all sorts of nonsense into deliveries. We'll have like 1,000 cars reach a country one month and none the next month and then people -- or like 100 the next month trickle in or something because those were the numbers that were registered in one month versus the next and people say Tesla sales dropped by a factor of 10.”For example, sales of Model S cars in electric-car-friendly Norway (Tesla’s largest market outside of the U.S.) varied greatly from one month to the next last year. In March 2014 Telsa delivered more than 1,300 cars to Norwegian customers, but that number dropped to a little over 400 the following month as Tesla focused on sending cars to China and elsewhere.Separating sales data from earnings reports shows the company recognizes the importance of breaking out sales numbers rather than simply citing them in a quarterly letter to shareholders. And it’s a little closer to the way other automakers report their sales – with separate regulatory filings pertaining specifically to sales numbers.Critics of Tesla’s sales reporting are unlikely to be satisfied. In addition to looking for more frequent sales reporting, they also would like to see where the cars are being sold.“Tesla Motors is valued like a large car company, but it doesn’t seem to value its investors enough to provide them with decent data,” said Bertel Schmitt, an outspoken Tesla critic who runs the Japan-based Daily Kanban automotive blog, in a post last Thursday. “Most large automakers provide monthly data, broken out by region. Tesla does not. All Tesla provides is one global number once every quarter.”\xa0Tesla's stock rose 6.34 percent during the regular trading session Monday to close at $203.10.""]"

Chris Christie did not block the bill.\xa0Original story begins here:Tesla Motors Inc. came closer Monday to winning approval to sell cars directly to consumers in New Jersey. The only thing standing in the way is Gov. Chris Christie, who could veto a move in Trenton to let zero-emission vehicle manufacturers “like Tesla Motors” market cars without a retail franchise system. The New Jersey Legislature approved the bill (A3216) that would let the Model S electric car maker reopen direct sales in the state against the wishes of established dealerships.This is a battle Tesla has been fighting in several U.S. states that prevent automotive manufacturers from also owning the dealerships that sell their cars. Tesla advocates say dealers are trying to block Tesla from controlling how its cars are sold. Defenders of the automotive retail franchise system say dealerships have a commercial interest in honoring warranty claims and fixing recall-related problems because they charge automakers for these services.“Tesla makes an excellent product, but their effort to bypass the neighborhood new car franchise systems, it’s not an effort to create choice for consumers,” said Jim Appleton, president of the New Jersey Coalition of Automotive Retailers. “It’s an effort to give Tesla special treatment and places the fox directly in charge of the chicken coop.”Diarmuid O’Connell, Tesla Motors\' head of corporate and business development, issued the following statement by email on Monday: “Today\'s vote was a win for New Jersey consumers, the free market, and the environment. We look forward to Governor Christie signing the bill when it reaches his desk so that Tesla can resume direct sales to the citizens of New Jersey as soon as possible.”The New Jersey Senate vote on Monday comes three days after similar legislation passed the Georgia House of Representatives that would lift a cap on sales of the Tesla Model S in a leading state for electric car sales.Last year, the Christie administration forced Tesla to close down its two showrooms, citing laws on the books that prevent automakers from directly selling to customers.""I\'m not pushing Tesla out; the state Legislature did,"" the governor said during a town hall meeting almost exactly a year ago. ""They passed a law — which is still on the books — which says if you want to sell cars in this state, you must go through an authorized dealer. My job is not to make the laws, it\'s to enforce the laws. And Tesla was operating outside the law.""Currently, 22 states allow Tesla to sell directly to consumers. Tesla operates “galleries” in states where it cannot sell directly to customers, but these outlets are prevented from offering test drives or delivering cars to customers directly.

But a little more than a year after entering the world’s largest auto market, the Fremont, California, automaker is facing sluggish Chinese demand for its Model S electric car, and now reports out of China are putting some numbers behind the company’s lackluster takeoff.Citing some of the estimated 200 Tesla employees that are being laid off as part of the company’s effort to change the way it’s selling and marketing cars there, Chinese media report that nearly half of the 4,800 Model S sedans shipped to China last year are languishing unsold.Though Tesla has not confirmed these reports, and did not respond to a Monday call for comment, CEO Elon Musk has admitted the Model S isn't selling as well as expected. The company is reportedly laying off about a third of its 600 employees in China, mostly members of its sales and marketing team.“Musk is coming on too strong, and he will not compromise on the Chinese market,” one departing Chinese Tesla sales executive told Chinese-language website DoNews. “He’s too impatient. Managers must meet his expectations and standards or leave. Tesla’s management division in the Chinese market has had insufficient clarity and unity. ... The Chinese management’s right to speak is almost zero.”About 2,300 of the unsold cars are reportedly stored at the Port of Tianjin and at a dealership lot in Shanghai. Others are parked at a facility owned by the largest Mercedes-Benz dealer in Beijing, according to CarNewsChina.com.During his fourth-quarter conference call with analysts last month, Musk said his company didn’t “execute people well on China last year,” and that the sales team was misinforming potential customers of the difficulties in charging the electric car in the country.“This sounds kind of brain dead, but our sales team was telling people that it was difficult to charge in China,” he said during the Feb. 11 call. “Even though this is not true, like that is pretty silly.”Though the number of Model S cars sent to China is small, Tesla’s performance is being measured by how well it increases demand for them, not just how many it sells in a given month. Tesla delivered an average of 208 cars a month in China last year, but in January that number was widely reported to have dropped to 120. (Tesla doesn’t report monthly sales like other automakers.)Telsa says it won't to be profitable under generally accepted accounting principles until after 2020, when it hopes to be selling 500,000 of its cars (the Model S, Model X crossover and a sub-$35,000 Model 3) annually, up from about 32,500 Model S sedans last year.One anonymous Tesla source told the online news service Guancha.cn earlier this month the pent-up inventory is largely due to cancellations of pre-orders for the Model S, whose starting price in China is about 648,000 yuan, or about $103,000. The policy asked for two deposits: one for about $2,400 and a second for nearly $40,000. The second deposit was difficult to collect, says another unnamed source, according to Chinese language site zhev.com.cn. Tesla increased the first deposit to about $8,000 in an effort to dissuade cancellations.Tesla has been simultaneously expanding its sales and marketing efforts in China while building out the infrastructure for its rapid-charge stations, known as Superchargers. The chargers offer free energy to Tesla Model S owners that can charge 80 percent of the battery in 20 minutes.Musk says low initial demand for the car in China has more to do with convincing buyers that they can plug their cars in when needed. The company currently lists 60 Supercharger stations in China right now, including six in or near Hong Kong. These exclude the rapidly growing number of standard plug-in outlets cropping up in China.China has been pushing increased electric vehicle use in its smog-choked cities through incentive programs to boost sales. But it also would prefer its citizens buy domestically produced electric cars, like the BYD e6, instead of buying imports, like the Model S. Because Tesla’s cars aren’t manufactured in China, the company pays a hefty import duty, which makes the cars more expensive than in the U.S. and Europe.China's wealthy luxury car buyers also prefer much roomier back seats, since so many of them use drivers. Tesla’s Model S doesn’t have the legroom of comparable fuel-burning luxury cars. Some luxury cars are made specifically to appease wealthy Chinese consumers’ expectations of roomier sedans. For example, the Chinese versions of the Mercedes-Benz C-Class, the Cadillac ATS and the Volvo S60 (all domestically manufactured in China) are longer versions of their counterparts in other parts of the world.""]"

Yet despite the jobs boost, the numbers signal a notable decline in the growth of America’s clean energy economy, and experts are blaming the trend on sluggish political support and waning financial incentives for alternative technologies.Last year’s clean energy jobs were created alongside 170 new projects -- including solar and wind energy installations, electric vehicle manufacturing and biofuel production -- and encompassed nearly every U.S. state, according to the jobs tracking analysis by Environmental Entrepreneurs, a business group and an affiliate of the Natural Resources Defense Council.Nevada, California and New York were the top three largest job creators, respectively, thanks largely to significant developments in the solar installation and energy efficiency sectors. In coming years, Nevada in particular could see a major jobs boom as Tesla Motors Inc. builds its $5 billion battery “gigafactory” in Reno. The plant could employ 6,500 people full-time once it's up and running, according to the company.“The clean energy revolution continues,” Bob Keefe, executive director of Environmental Entrepreneurs, said in a statement.The report’s authors cited the expiration of a key wind energy tax credit as a major reason for the slower jobs growth. The production tax credit, which gave wind farm operators 2.3 cents for every kilowatt their turbines generated per hour, expired at the end of 2013. As a result, the number of new wind industry jobs dropped from 9,700 positions in 2013 to just 6,800 jobs last year, according to the report.“The expiration of the wind industry’s most important federal policy … was a major setback for wind and continues to hamper its growth,” the report said. U.S. developers added just 4,850 megawatts in new turbine capacity in 2014, down from a record 13,000 megawatts in 2012, the American Wind Energy Association reported last month.New construction and manufacturing jobs related to the mass transit industry also fell notably last year, as states declined to invest in new light rail projects or expand their public transportation systems. Environmental Entrepreneurs called on federal and state policymakers to increase incentives for clean energy projects and provide companies with the “regulatory certainty” they need to expand operations and employ more people.In the report, the group urged lawmakers to implement the Obama administration’s proposed Clean Power Plan, which would require states to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from coal-fired power plants and adopt cleaner energy sources, including renewables, nuclear and geothermal power. Industry advocates also called for strengthening state renewable energy mandates that require utilities to source a certain percentage of their electricity mix from alternative supplies.The 2014 jobs count follows a separate report by the U.S. Energy Information Administration, which found that electricity generation from nonhydro renewables -- including wind, solar, biomass and geothermal -- jumped by 10.9 percent last year compared with 2013. Solar power’s contribution to the U.S. mix more than doubled, while wind grew by about 8.3 percent, biomass by 5.7 percent and geothermal by 5.4 percent, according to the Electric Power Monthly report. By contrast, coal-fired power grew by only 0.3 percent, and nuclear power by 1 percent.""]"

But following a report Monday out of Shanghai that the company will reduce its workforce there by a third, or 200 employees, the company’s stock price ended the day down 1.55 percent to $190.88, its lowest closing price since May 15.The company’s stock is now trading $100 off its all-time closing high of $286.04, which it reached on Sept. 4. The company’s stock price has dipped nearly 12 percent since Tesla reported on Feb. 11 a $108 million net loss in the fourth quarter. Tesla began selling its Model S in China last August in an effort to cash in on the country’s fast-growing luxury car market.“It’s an important growth market for them and the fact sales are weaker than expected is a negative for their story,” said S&P Capital IQ automotive equity analyst Efraim Levy. “China is a potential hiccup to their growth plan.”Tesla has not confirmed how many in its Chinese workforce are being cut, but in a February conference call following the announcement of the company’s fourth-quarter results, CEO Elon Musk indicated his unhappiness at his China team’s performance. “This whole China thing has been blown way out of proportion. We didn’t execute people well on China last year,” he said during the Feb. 11 call. “Unfortunately, this sounds kind of brain-dead, but our sales team was telling people that it was difficult to charge [electric cars] in China.”Indeed, one reason electric car sales in China have been slow to take off is a lack of infrastructure. Tesla’s supercharger stations are still being fleshed out, so Chinese consumers are taking a wait-and-see attitude toward the Model S.Tesla began delivering its cars to China early last year, and Tesla Model S sales there began to pick up in September, according to vehicle-registration data compiled by JL Warren Capital, a China-focused equity research firm. Monthly Model S registrations in China, a solid measure of how many cars a company is selling, remained above 400 vehicles a month through January. But shipments of cars to China from California have dropped off precipitously, with only 10 vehicles in January. This suggests the company has an ample supply of its cars in China to meet demand.Tesla doesn’t disclose monthly sales data like other automakers, so the closest ongoing measure of the company’s performance comes from government vehicle registration data. The company says it doesn’t reveal these numbers because it’s facing a supply constraint. Musk says it can’t produce the cars fast enough to meet demand. But for now that’s not a problem in China.']"

https://www.ibtimes.com/tesla-motors-2014-annual-report-here-are-eight-tesla-motors-most-significant-risks-1831450,Tesla Motors 2014 Annual Report: Here Are Eight Of Tesla Motors’ Most Significant Risks To Its Future,Angelo Young,02/28/15,9:59 AM,"['Tesla Motors Inc. CEO Elon Musk wants to be a key player in the future of zero-emission motorized transport. It’s been his stated goal all along for the company to become a maker of modestly priced electric cars.But, to get there, Tesla has to move from being a boutique maker of expensive electric cars for wealthy American buyers to a company that churns out hundreds of thousands of electric cars a year -- a project so rife with peril that automotive history is littered with failed ventures.Late Thursday, the maker of the critically acclaimed Tesla Model S released its 2014 annual report, which in accordance with U.S. disclosure laws, outlines potential pitfalls the company could encounter as it embarks on an effort to grow annual vehicle production from 35,000 last year to “a few million” annually within a decade.That pace of growth would be unprecedented in the automotive industry, and Tesla is attempting to do it while simultaneously building out its manufacturing capacity, global showrooms and marketing, as well as a massively expensive network of Tesla charging stations and a $5 billion so-called gigafactory to produce batteries in Nevada. And it has two new models in the works, the Model X crossover, planned for launch this year, and the $35,000 Model 3.Tesla is frequently compared with technology companies that outsource production of small gadgets. But the reality is much different.“We believe it is important for investors to remember that Tesla is an auto manufacturer, first and foremost, which is an inherently capital-intensive business,” Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst John Lovallo\xa0wrote in a note to clients Thursday. “In our view, the gigafactory investment will translate to even more capital intensity and add further pressure to margins and returns.”Lovallo is one of the few Wall Street analysts raising these kinds of warning flags, but Tesla’s leadership is also aware of the risks that could cause the company to hit a wall in its automotive ambitions. Its 2014 annual report has a lengthy section devoted to outlining risks to the firm’s future success. Among them are the usual cautionary statements one would expect from an automaker, such as the risk to its reputation should its cars be subject to a product-safety recall or the hazard of unexpected increases in operational costs. Delays feature prominently in the company’s risk assessment, too, as it has a series of deadlines approaching in the next five years.Below are risks outlined in Tesla’s 2014 annual report that underscore the unique challenges facing the company.Used Tesla Model S sedans may wind up being worth less than expected. Tesla began a leasing program in the U.S. in 2013 that it expanded to Europe last year. Under the company’s resale value guarantee, customers have the option of selling their used cars back to the firm after 36-39 months of use. Tesla is betting it can sell these cars for a set price, but how much one of these three-year-old models will be worth in the aftermarket is a big unknown right now.“The introduction of our resale value guarantee and leasing programs may result in lower revenues and profits and exposes us to resale risk to the extent many customers elect to return their vehicles to us and the residual values are lower than our estimates,” Tesla says in its annual report. “If we fail to effectively manage the residual, financing and credit risks for our recently launched Model S leasing program, our business may suffer.”Customers might modify the Model S in a way that harms its performance. Most automakers aren’t concerned with the way customers change their cars after they’ve been purchased. But Tesla is a new company with an innovative vehicle that’s being closely watched, so it’s very particular about what customers do to it.Here’s what Tesla says about customization:“If our vehicle owners customize our vehicles or change the charging infrastructure with aftermarket products, the vehicle may not operate properly, which could harm our business. ... Unauthorized control or manipulation of our vehicles’ systems may cause them to operate improperly or not at all, or compromise their safety and data security, which could result in loss of confidence in us and our vehicles and harm our business.”Tesla needs government-mandated incentives. Because Tesla makes only electric cars, it benefits more than other automakers from carbon trading. The company receives credits for every Model S it sells. These credits are sold to other automakers, which buy them to comply with regulations aimed at lowering carbon emissions. The aim is to incentivize manufacturers to build cleaner cars. During the past three years, Tesla has earned a total of $451.2 million from regulatory carbon offset credits in 10 states, including its key California market. The income from carbon trading has increased more than 400 percent, to a little more than $216 million last year. The company also benefits from state and federal tax incentives provided to electric-vehicle buyers, which lowers the cost of the Tesla Model S. If those laws were revoked, then the firm’s income would fall.“The unavailability, reduction or elimination of, or uncertainty regarding, government and economic incentives in the U.S. and abroad could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects,” Tesla says in its annual report.Tesla’s battery packs lose range over time. Just like your smartphone or tablet device, the capabilities of Tesla’s lithium-ion batteries erode over time. The company is working to improve the technology with its battery supplier Panasonic, and it says its gigafactory will advance the technology. \xa0The firm offers no estimated loss of charge over time for the Model S, but claims the packs in the Tesla Roadster -- produced from 2008 to 2012 -- lose 30 percent of the vehicle’s 244-mile range (to about 171 miles) after 100,000 miles or seven years. It says these batteries also lose as much as 10 percent of their range “when operated continuously in 0°C temperatures.”“The range and power of our electric vehicles on a single charge declines over time, and this may negatively influence potential customers’ decisions whether to purchase our vehicles,” Tesla says in its annual report.Customers have to learn how the Model S handles braking. One of the more interesting features in the Model S is one that requires consumers to relearn how to carry out acceleration and braking. Because of the car’s advanced regenerative braking ability (with stopping energy being harvested and sent to the battery), the car decelerates as the driver lifts his or her foot off the acceleration pedal. The brake pedal is only there for use when the car needs to be stopped immediately. Drivers thus have to get accustomed to using the gas pedal for both acceleration and deceleration.Here’s how Tesla describes the risk: “The operation of our vehicles is different from internal-combustion engine vehicles, and our customers may experience difficulty operating them properly, including difficulty transitioning between different methods of braking.”Tesla could be exposed to consumer-privacy protection laws. The automaker collects data on driver usage and sends over-the-air updates to the vehicle’s operating system. While it assures customers that this data is solely used internally to improve the customer experience and to diagnose technical issues, it could be exposed to future privacy-related issues.According to Tesla’s annual report, “We retain certain personal information about our customers and may be subject to various privacy and consumer protection laws.”']"

With the iPod and iTunes, it shook up the music industry. Now, the pioneering tech company may be looking to rock the automotive market. According to several recent reports, Apple has stealthily hired hundreds of employees, including dozens from the automotive industry, to work on a secret research project located somewhere outside of its Cupertino, California, campus.The project involves development of an electric-vehicle prototype that resembles a minivan, a source told the Wall Street Journal. Code-named “Titan,” Apple’s latest project is a big departure from its lineup of computing and online products, which begs the question: What does Apple want with a car?1. Make Money Selling CarsIt’s possible that Apple’s fixation on the car industry is straightforward – it sees an untapped market for new, innovative products. The company’s strategy of selling premium consumer electronics could translate well to autos. Apple will have the opportunity to tap into a market that saw total U.S. sales of $500 billion in 2014, according to Gene Munster, senior research analyst at Piper Jaffray. Getting even 10 percent of that could bring in upwards of another $50 billion in revenue.While automotive research and development staff have been recruited for the new Apple project, automakers have been left out of the loop. ""They don\'t appear to want a lot of help from carmakers,"" said a source speaking to Reuters.2. Dominate In-Vehicle InfotainmentGoogle and Apple made their way onto millions of vehicle dashboards in 2014 via Android Auto and CarPlay, respectively. But Apple may want to go beyond that. With a car of its own, the company would control a moving platform that provides a temporarily captive audience for its vast array of content and services – from Beats to Siri.“We’re getting to the tipping point of the software-defined vehicle,” said Thilo Koslowski, vp for automotive at research company Gartner. “It’s where Apple sees an opportunity to get linked into [the market]. By 2016, data connectivity and a connected experience in vehicles are expected to be in demand by consumers. So from a timing perspective, now is the time.” The connected-car market has lots of room for growth. Only about 10 percent of the 250 million vehicles on the road in the U.S. in 2014 carried wireless data systems, according to ABI Research.An Apple car would also give the tech giant control of data gathered from the car, a matter raising increasing privacy concerns. Detroit came under the scrutiny of the Government Accountability Office last year for inadequately protecting location data and other information hovered up from customers’ in-vehicle systems.3. Discover Breakthrough Mobile TechnologiesEven if a physical car doesn’t emerge out of the so-called Titan project, Apple will have gained valuable information on how to expand CarPlay’s presence beyond the dashboard. After all, it’s not uncommon for Apple to research and prototype products in-house but never bring them to market. One such example is a MacBook Pro with an integrated 3G cell phone modem and antenna, which was spotted on eBay in 2011. The auction was eventually taken down after Apple lodged a complaint.The company could also use its findings to further improve its line of mobile products, including its Apple Maps app, which it has been looking to enhance since it replaced Google Maps for iOS in 2012. Research on electric vehicles might also help Apple produce a longer-lasting lithium-ion battery for mobile devices like the iPhone and iPad.4. Put Cash Reserve To Good UseApple is the most profitable and valuable company in the world -- witness its cash on hand of $178 billion. While it has tried to whittle that down through dividend payouts and stock buybacks, it may have other plans for its massive piggy bank. “They have the money to do whatever they want to do,” ABI Research practice director Dominique Bonte said. “They could even buy a car company without a problem.” One such candidate is Tesla, which angel investor Jason Calacanis predicts will be purchased by Apple for $75 billion in 18 months -- but who knows whether Tesla founder and CEO Elon Musk would actually bite.If Apple were to tap into the electric car market, it would be entering a tiny segment of the auto industry, with only hundreds of thousands of electric vehicles sold globally in 2014. Of those vehicles, just over 31,000 were from Tesla, a company that has managed to poach 150 of Apple’s former employees.5. Fulfill Steve Jobs’ Electric DreamsBefore Tim Cook became CEO, Apple co-founder and former chief Steve Jobs, who died in 2012, had cars on his mind. “Look at the car industry; it\'s a tragedy in America. Who is designing the cars?” Apple board member and J. Crew CEO Millard Drexler said in 2012, according to Cnet. ""Steve\'s dream before he died was to design an iCar."" An iCar may not have materialized during Jobs’ tenure, but Apple had certainly been exploring the possibility of what it could do in vehicles, as seen by several patents filed by the company over the years, including a dashboard patent that would eventually become CarPlay.Apple representatives did not immediately respond to a call seeking comment on the company\'splans.']"

It\'s all about autonomous driving,"" the source said.Apple may be pursuing mainly expertise rather than full-scale partnerships, a pattern that has a long history.\xa0\xa0\xa0In 2005, two years before it released the iPhone, Apple worked with Motorola, then the world\'s second-largest mobile phone maker, to develop the Rokr, a phone with integrated iTunes music and media-playing features. Capable of only holding 100 songs, the phone flopped, and briefly called into question Apple\'s ability to break into new product categories.\xa0\xa0\xa0 More recently, in developing the soon-to-be-launched Apple Watch, the company held limited talks with Swiss watchmakers, but no broad-based alliance emerged from the discussions.Instead of partnerships, Apple pursued a go-it-alone strategy and turned to poaching talent from top watchmaking brands.Among the high-profile hirings Apple has made from the auto industry was Johann Jungwirth, President & CEO, Mercedes-Benz Research and Development North America. Jungwirth could not be reached for comment.A spokesman for Daimler (DAIGn.DE) on Saturday said that the team of engineers which developed the Mercedes-Benz autonomous car remains intact and that Jungwirth was mainly specialized in integrating smartphone functionality and developing advanced user experiences.According to Jungwirth\'s Linkedin profile he joined Apple in September. At Daimler his responsibilities from March 2009 to September 2014 included overseeing Connected Car & UI Telematics, Autonomous Driving, Advanced User Experience Design, Powertrain & eDrive, Advanced Exterior Design and Mercedes Benz style, group research and regulatory affairs, the profile said.(Editing by Noah Barkin/Hugh Lawson)']"

The car runs solely on electric power, but currently has no plans for a “self-driving” or autonomous vehicle, the report said. The project is code-named ""Titan"". Rival Google Inc. has worked on a self-driving car which it says will hit the road in 2020.It “resembles a minivan,” and may not be ready for production for several years, the report said. Apple has built multiple working models for products which never made it to the consumer market, which it could decide to do with Titan. It might also use the car to test out other products like CarPlay, but the size of the staff its using shows that its serious about the project.Apple has more than enough money to spend on the project, with $180 billion in cash, nearly as much as the market capitalization of GM, Ford and Volkswagen combined, The Verge noted Friday.CEO Tim Cook signed off on the project almost one year ago, allowing former Ford Motor Company engineer and Apple VP Steve Zadesky the ability to pull staff from any of the manufacturer’s departments, the WSJ said. Zadesky previously was part of the design team of the iPod and iPhone. It would be “several years” before Apple could complete the car and obtain the necessary safety certifications, according to the report.Apple employees have visited contract manufacturers that could build a car or its components, including Magna Steyr, which has built cars for Mercedes-Benz and BMW. The Financial Times reported earlier Friday that Apple created a top-secret lab for such a project, located in Silicon Valley away from the company’s Cupertino headquarters.“Look at the car industry; it\'s a tragedy in America. Who is designing the cars?” Apple board member and J. Crew CEO Millard Drexler said in 2012. Apple’s late founder and former CEO Steve Jobs’ “dream before he died was to design an iCar,” Drexler said.If Apple brings its electric car into mass production, it could potentially help the company maintain its explosive revenue growth. The task of getting a vehicle on the road is extremely expensive, and would require hundreds of millions of dollars to move forward.

The stock shed more than $13.92, or 6.56 percent, to $198.88, in premarket trading (at the time of publication), the lowest level since CEO Elon Musk said last month that China sales were down in the fourth quarter.“While other automakers are beginning to emulate Tesla in important respects, it is not lost on us that Tesla is in some ways beginning to look more like other automakers,” JPMorgan Chase & Co. analysts said in a note to investors on Thursday, referring to Tesla’s larger-than-expected capital expenditures (the money a company spends on upgrading or acquiring assets), which the bank sees rising toward levels that resemble much larger automakers.Meanwhile, larger automakers are starting to enter the electric vehicle market at both the luxury and mass-market ends, which could check Tesla’s efforts to become the world’s largest producer of lower-priced electric cars, a market currently dominated by the Nissan Leaf. Electric cars make up less than 1 percent of the total automotive market, but demand is growing.Analysts' ActionsJPMorgan downgraded Tesla's stock from Neutral to Underweight on Thursday, which means it believes the company’s stock will perform below the automotive industry average for the next eight to 12 months. Tesla is expected to spend $1.5 billion in capital expenditures in 2015, higher than JPMorgan’s estimate of $900 million.Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas, who is generally bullish on Tesla, said in a note Thursday that Tesla’s costs are “looking eye-wateringly high” and that the company is pushing the “insane button” on its capital expenditures. Nevertheless, the bank maintained its Overweight rating, which mean Morgan Stanley sees Tesla’s stock outperforming the industry average return. The bank sees the company’s shares doing well despite the challenges in this important transition year.Tesla says it will sell 55,000 cars in 2015, including the Tesla Model X utility car due out by the fall, up from about 31,600 last year and about 22,500 in 2013. The company said Wednesday that deliveries, earnings, revenue, margins and operating expenses missed Wall Street estimates, while its expenditures are rising faster than expected.Insider TradeMeanwhile Tesla Motors Director Kimbal Musk, Elon’s brother, sold 4,600 shares of Tesla on Monday, three days before the dismal earnings forecast, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission posted on Wednesday. The average transaction price was $214.64 for a total of $987,344. Company executives are granted stock options as part of their compensation that automatically vest according to a schedule and performance benchmarks.

Based on Tesla’s lithium-ion battery technology, the new battery is expected to help the company become a leader in the growing home energy-storage market.Speaking during an earnings conference call on Wednesday, Musk said that the design of the battery is complete, and production would begin in about six months. Although the company did not provide any date for the product's launch, Musk said that he was pleased with the result.“We are going to unveil the Tesla home battery, the consumer battery that would be for use in people’s houses or businesses fairly soon,” Bloomberg quoted Musk as saying.During an earnings call last year, Musk had talked about his plans to make a product that would be fitted into consumers’ homes, instead of their cars.

Nearly three years after Internet entrepreneur and film producer Jeffrey Skoll became the first Tesla Model S customer, the company has sold roughly 55,000 of its innovative electric vehicles in its effort to become the world’s first mass producer of cars that abstain from internal combustion engines.If all goes as Tesla CEO Elon Musk plans, before the end of the year the Model S will be sharing showroom space with the highly anticipated Model X SUV. And by the end of the year, the company’s Fremont, California, factory will be buzzing with two assembly lines churning out 2,000 vehicles a week, twice the current pace.As Tesla winds down 2014 with its fourth quarter and annual earnings report , due out Wednesday after markets close, company watchers say they’re largely satisfied with\xa0 Tesla, despite lackluster performance in China, a key global market where the company reportedly sold only 140 cars last month.”This is a transition period for Tesla. They’re moving from the Model S to saying, ‘were still on track with the Model X and Model 3,’” said Carter Driscoll, senior equity analyst for clean technologies at New York boutique investment bank MLV & Co.Analysts who watch Tesla will track the following key developments in 2015 to measure how well Tesla transitions into producing more than one model.2015 Sales: Model S sales began in earnest in the fourth quarter of 2012, when it delivered a little over 2,400 Model S cars. The company has more than tripled quarterly sales deliveries since then. In 2013, almost 22,500 Model S sedans were delivered to customers. And despite shutting down the factory temporarily last summer to install more robots and set up the plant for the production for the Model X, Tesla sold more than 31,000 vehicles last year.This year, look for growth to expand considerably if Tesla can begin delivering on its current back-orders of the Model X, which depends on when the SUV begin rolling off the assembly line. It’s been delayed twice already, and company engineers are still working out some issues around its unique “falcon wing” doors. \xa0 Musk has said the company is hobbled by a production constraint—that it can’t fulfill orders fast enough.Last year, the company trimmed the number of options in order to speed up production. Investors will want to see Tesla close the gap in how long it takes to deliver a car that’s been ordered. Currently, the waiting time for delivering a Model S to a U.S. customer is about two months and generally longer for customers abroad.2015 gross margin: Tesla is considered to have a lot of profit growth potential, so investors aren’t paying much attention to net profit, as they would with well-established carmakers. One of the most important metrics for an up-and-coming company is gross margin, revenue minus the cost of making the cars.Tesla’s gross margins have been growing, which reflects its ability to make its cars more efficiently and suggests it’s establishing good relations with its suppliers, who are dropping costs as Tesla orders more from them. Analysts track the company’s gross margin excluding the money it receives from California Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) credits, which help the company’s financials but aren’t considered an accurate representation because it’s a government incentive that helps the company improve its numbers.But even without ZEV credits, Tesla is moving toward an impressive 25 percent gross margin, which increases as the company both grows sales an pays less to make its cars.2015 Spending: Tesla’s capital expenditures – what the company spends to acquire or upgrade physical assets – was approaching a billion dollars last year as it buys ups space for its quick-charging stations, invests in its factory capacity and builds out its global marketing and dealership infrastructure. Investors will look to see if expenses continue to grow in 2015, and if those investment are paying off. This is particularly important in overseas markets the company is developing, namely in Europe and Asia.2015 ‘Gigafactory’ partners: Four months after Musk and Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval announced the ‘gigafactory’ battery plant, the steel frame of the plant is beginning to rise from the Nevada desert east of Reno.The plant, which will be run by Telsa’s partner and battery cell supplier Panasonic Corp., is expected to be partially running by 2017 and at full capacity three years later. Work at the site in the Tahoe-Reno Industrial Center is well underway, but it isn’t completely funded.Tesla is investing in $2 billion in the project that could cost as much as $5 billion. Panasonic, which will run the plant when it’s completed, is investing hundreds of millions. But the project will need more partners, which will likely be key suppliers for the manufacture of the battery cells. This year more partners should be announced.']"

The reason is simple: If battery-power is the future of mass transport, as the CEO and chief architect of Tesla Motors envisions, then his company will become a David in a field of Goliaths.“Suddenly it looks as if the car industry is about to disrupt Tesla’s high-flying plans, not the other way around,” said automotive industry veteran Bertel Schmitt ahead of Tesla’s fourth quarter and full-year 2014 earnings announcement due Wednesday. “Silently humming around test tracks everywhere are prototypes for [electric vehicles] that go twice as far on a single charge,” said Schmitt, who runs the Tokyo-based Daily Kanban blog.At the luxury end, German automakers are preparing Tesla Model S challengers. Audi’s Q8 e-Tron, due out in 2017, is aimed at the upcoming Tesla Model X crossover. An all-electric version of the Porsche Panamera is scheduled for release by 2018. And the Mercedes-Benz EV has a tentative 2021 release date.For the mass market, General Motors and Nissan are planning modestly priced electric cars with improved battery and drivetrain technologies. The Chevrolet Bolt, revealed last month in Detroit, is due out around the same time as the Tesla Model 3. Nissan CEO Carlos Ghosn said in December that the Nissan Leaf, the automotive history’s bestselling electric car, will soon have a range of around 250 miles, up from about 84 miles. Volkswagen AG (which owns Porsche and Audi) has announced it will launch 20 green vehicles, including all-electric and gasoline-electric hybrids, for China, a key market in Tesla’s global growth plans.    CAPTION: Top: A conceptual rendering of the upcoming $35,000 Tesla Model 3 by Singapore-based Theophilus Chin.

Tesla’s ambitions to sell hundreds of thousands of $35,000 Model 3 EVs will be challenged by GM and Nissan.  Photo: theophiluschin.com, General Motors, Nissan  Most of these cars will be on the market by the time Tesla plans to hit a 500,000-vehicle annual sales benchmark in 2020, with the help of its planned $35,000 Tesla Model 3The car is due out around 2017. But even as the competition for fully electric cars stiffens, Musk recently doubled down on his projections. Speaking last month at an automotive conference in Detroit, he said Tesla would be making “a few million cars” a decade from now. In 2014, the company sold about 32,000 cars, according to estimates that will be confirmed next week.“One thing is abundantly clear: Elon Musk views the future of transportation, and not just automotive, as electric,” Akshay Anand, analyst at the automotive pricing provider Kelley Blue Book, said in an email. “His comments on\xa0Tesla hoping to sell ‘a few million cars by 2025’ indicate he has plenty in store for the brand. Still, this is a tall task, given that Musk indicated the Model 3 won’t hit full production [until] around 2020.”Tesla will report financial results after markets close on Wednesday. Economists polled by Thomson Reuters expect $1.23 billion in revenue in the fourth quarter of 2014, up from $761.3 million in the same quarter the previous year. Net profit is seen increasing to $46.1 million from $45.9 million. Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter are forecast at 31 cents, down from 33 cents in the same quarter last year.For the year, economists expect Tesla to report $3.7 billion in 2014 revenue, up from $2.48 billion in 2013. Net profit is predicted to be $80.1 million, down from $103.6 million the previous year. Adjusted earnings per share is seen falling to 57 cents in 2014 compared to 78 cents in 2013. The public can listen to the earnings conference call webcast here starting at 5:30 EST on Feb. 11.A significant portion of Tesla’s revenue comes from the sale of zero-emission credits in California, where Tesla has an advantage because it doesn't make cars with internal-combustion engines. It also generates revenue through a lease-accounting arrangement with banks, a deal that lets Tesla report all the revenue it would collect over three-year Model S leases at once instead of spreading out the revenue gains over multiple quarters, in accordance with general lease-accounting principles. Musk has said the company won’t turn a profit based on generally accepted accounting principles\xa0until 2020.Still, the company’s bullish investors view Tesla as a growth stock, much like Amazon.com, a company with future profit-growth potential. This means revenue growth is more important than profit. As long as Tesla can keep increasing car sales, and maintain ideal profit margins, then investors will be satisfied with losses. Tesla's stock price is up 28 percent over the past year, to around $223 on Thursday.“Revenues should accelerate to a 63 percent rise in 2015,” S&P automotive equity analysts Efraim Levy said in a research note. “In November, the company warned of sharply lower than-expected profits in the fourth quarter due to production shortfalls, but expects to see more than 50 percent production growth in 2015. Margins may fluctuate among quarters, but we see improvement overall due to manufacturing cost reductions and more efficiencies from higher Model S production.”Tesla’s costs are running high. It’s spending heavily on development of the Model X and Model 3; a typical car can cost a billion dollars to develop before the first one is sold. It continues to flesh out its global network of rapid-charge stations. It will eventually need to expand capacity at its sole Fremont factory, and invest in more production capacity elsewhere to meet Musk’s goals. Meanwhile Tesla is building a massive multi-billion-dollar battery facility east of Reno, Nevada, in partnership with its battery supplier, Panasonic Corp. Boosting battery supply and lowering cell costs is vital to Tesla’s Model 3 plans.Wall Street will want to know on Wednesday how many cars Tesla sold globally in the fourth quarter and for the year. Last month, Musk said revenue in China “was not a significant contributor to our sales” in the quarter, which immediately drive down the company's stock price by 6 percent (it has since recovered). Like other luxury automakers, Tesla is betting China’s rapidly expanding luxury car market, along with government efforts to combat pollution in its smog-choked cities by promoting EV use, will be a boon to sales. However, wealthy Chinese consumers there will need to see more Tesla charging stations – which offer free power to Tesla customers – in the mainland before they can be enticed to buy more Model S sedans, Musk has said.\xa0Investors will also want to know how many cars Musk plans to sell this year, and whether the Model X will come out as scheduled in early 2016. The highly anticipated luxury crossover has been delayed three times as the company works out some engineering challenges, including its so-called “falcon wing” doors designed to allow easier movement inside the cabin when they’re open.Musk has lofty ambitions for Tesla that might be too optimistic. To go from around 32,000 cars in 2014 to “a few million” in 10 years is unheard of in the automotive industry. “For a company of Tesla’s size, it is absolutely impossible to scale [to grow production quickly while lowering manufacturing costs] from nobody to a size bigger than Audi in just 10 years,” said Schmitt. “It took Audi more than 80 years to get from zero to the 1,740,000 units it made in 2014.”For now Musk seems confident he can do what's never been done before, even in the face of an increasingly crowded electric vehicle market.\xa0For more conceptual digital car renderings like the Model 3 image above, visit theophiluschin.com.""]"

But Apple is trying to fight back.The tech firm has been doing some counter-poaching of its own from Tesla, with offers of a $250,000 signing bonus and a 60 percent salary bump. But unlike Tesla, it's been able to recruit just a few, Musk told Bloomberg.In other industries, such as fashion and luxury products, Apple has found more success.

Uber is reportedly aware of the plans, and is also working on a robotic car project of its own.Google is preparing its own taxi-calling app, which will work alongside its driverless cars. The idea of a Google “robo-taxi” service has surfaced since it introduced the first prototype of the self-driving car, but the search giant is farther along on its own ride-hailing app than was previously thought, according to a Bloomberg report.In response to the plans, Uber is considering removing Google’s chief legal officer from its board of directors. Google Ventures invested $258 million into Uber in August 2013, and shortly thereafter, Google’s chief legal officer, David Drummond, joined Uber’s board of directors. The deal was Google’s venture capital division’s biggest ever, and it invested even more less than a year later.A source from Uber’s board reportedly told Bloomberg that Drummond has informed Uber about Google’s plans, even showing them images of a Google-branded taxi app being used by the search giant’s employees. The report says Uber is now considering whether Drummond should be asked to resign, and it announced Monday that it was working on its own autonomous vehicle, or self-driving car.“We believe the most sensible option is for legislators to allow new transport platforms like Uber to co-exist with established forms of transportation within a carefully-formed regulatory environment that upholds safety standards whilst providing consumers with more choice,” Uber said in a statement.Uber will compete with Google as well as Tesla Motors, Volkswagen Group and a host of other automakers to advance self-driving car technology.Uber said it would partner with Carnegie Mellon University for a research facility based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, that would develop a driverless car to “co-exist” alongside the human drivers that power its taxi app. It already relies on Google Maps for its smartphone apps on iPhone and Android, giving the search giant a treasure trove of data about ride-sharing trips.Google announced earlier this month that its own self-driving car would be ready by 2020. Its prototypes lack manual navigation features like a steering wheel or petals, and reportedly have trouble operating in bad weather -- a major drawback to all of the driverless-car technologies currently under development.One sign of strife between the companies was an announcement last week that Google would start displaying information from a number of apps inside of its Google Now service, which included apps like Pandora Internet Radio, AirBnb and Uber-competitor Lyft, but not Uber itself.']"

In an interview with Reuters, Chris Urmson, project director for Google’s self-driving car project, said the Internet giant is working with traditional auto suppliers as well as tech-based hardware companies to get the job done.Google hasn’t decided whether it will manufacture the self-driving car itself or sell software and systems to traditional manufacturers like Ford Motor Co., General Motors Co., Toyota Motor Corp., Daimler AG and Volkswagen AG. Urmson said Google was in talks with all five about production proposals.Google’s latest autonomous vehicles were built by Roush, a specialty manufacturer in Detroit. The compact, pod-like prototypes have a stylized grill that looks like a goofy grin, but Urmson told Reuters the design probably would evolve as the project moves forward.A fleet of Google’s self-driving cars will soon be deployed sans steering wheels or pedals, he said. Continental AG, Robert Bosch, LG Electronics and Nvidia Corp. are all developing parts and systems along with Google, and Continental said it began discussions with Google in 2012, the report said.Urmson’s timeline for when Google’s self-driving car will be widely available aligns with that of Tesla Motors Inc. CEO Elon Musk, but the two dispute who will be first to sell one, and whether legislating rules for the technology will be a major impediment to its adoption.

The stock rebounded to around $190 after the opening bell.“I expect we’ll achieve profitability in 2020,” Musk said Tuesday at the Automotive News World Congress event\xa0during the 2015 North American International Auto Show’s press days, adding that he expects to build “a few million cars” a year by 2025, up from less than 40,000 last year. By comparison, Toyota, the world’s largest automaker, took 77 years to reach annual production of about 10 million vehicles, achieved in 2014.The stock price lost nearly 7 percent to $190 in after-market trading on Tuesday and is down over 8 percent for the year as lower oil prices raise concerns that consumers will buy fewer green vehicles. \xa0The company’s stock price dipped under $200 late Tuesday for the first time since May 2014, but it remains well above its 52-week low of $136.67.Musk also said the pace of China sales declined in the fourth quarter over Chinese consumer perceptions that the Tesla network of quick-charging stations – which give Model S owners free electricity to charge up their cars -- isn’t big enough yet.Musk also said his company isn’t likely to turn a profit until 2020, the year Tesla wants to be churning out 500,000 electric cars a year, most of them the planned $35,000 Tesla Model 3, which is half the price of the entry-level Tesla Model S.China is key to Tesla’s global growth strategy. The country is not only the world’s largest auto market with a fast-growing demand for luxury vehicles, it’s also promoting electric vehicle use through tax incentives to mitigate its urban smog problem. But it would prefer consumers buy domestic cars or foreign cars that are manufactured domestically under joint partnerships with local companies.Musk also backed off his hard stance on his battle in the states to allow Tesla to establish its own dealerships, indicating he's leaving open the possibility of selling his cars through franchised dealerships. Five states ban Tesla from establishing its own stores, while nine have laws on the books banning manufacturers from operating their own retail outlets. Texas, for example, bans Tesla from giving test drives or selling cars from their showrooms. As a result, customers can visit so-called galleries but must have the car delivered to them from out of state. Tesla is considering a federal challenge to these estate laws.\xa0""]"

On Tuesday, auto industry executives will hear the Telsa co-founder preach to a sold-out choir at the Automotive News World Congress during the 2015 North American International Auto Show in Detroit.“Mr. Musk is expected to criticize larger automakers for not responding to Tesla even more aggressively,” the Wall Street Journal said in an analysis piece about Musk’s return to Motor City, the billionaire inventor's first trip to the Detroit auto show since 2013. “He denounces the rest of the industry as only halfheartedly trying to produce battery-powered cars for the masses, not just early adopters.”As more automakers introduce hybrid and electric vehicles, pressure increases on Tesla to move beyond its luxury roots and come up with its own inexpensive consumer car. If Musk is setting out to lecture a long-established industry on how to make cars greener, he’ll be doing it not far from where General Motors unveiled on Monday a concept electric car, the Chevrolet Bolt. His talk also will\xa0come a week after Nissan CEO Carlos Ghosn said his company would soon double the range of the Nissan Leaf, the best-selling electric car in history. Both cars would be priced at around $30,000, both would travel at least 200 miles per charge, and both could be in the market by 2017 — the year Tesla said it would release its planned sub-$40,000 Model 3.    GM unveiled its Chevrolet Bolt concept car on Monday. The company says the $30,000 electric car would have a 200-mile range, out in 2017. Tesla is working on a $35,000 Model 3 electric car with a range of over 200 miles.  Photo: Chevrolet  The last time Musk addressed industry executives at the Detroit auto show, Tesla’s stock price was $35 and the Tesla Model S, a luxury electric car that starts at $71,000 and can quickly top six figures with pricey add-ons, had been on the market for only\xa0seven months. Today, a share of Tesla costs more than $200 and the company says Model S deliveries in 2014 will meet or exceed the 33,000-unit target, a downward revision from an earlier company estimate of 35,000; we won’t know the final number until the company’s annual report comes out next month.But just as Telsa has changed over the past two years, the industry has, too. Ford and GM sell more pickup trucks in the U.S. in a month than the number of electric cars sold last year worldwide, signaling that among the biggest challenges to Tesla’s success are consumers themselves. Automakers are not sitting idle, either, as they work to meet more stringent government-mandated carbon emissions targets. Also, the nascent but increasing demand and interest in fully electric and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles is pushing innovations.Nissan Motor Co. said last week sales of its sub-$30,000 Leaf \xa0jumped 130 percent to 22,610 units in the U.S. in 2014, aided in part by a price cut in 2013 that put the Leaf’s cost in a sweet spot for urban consumers. Ghosn has said he sees an upward trajectory this year, which could put the Smyrna, Tennessee-manufactured Leaf deliveries over 40,000.“[Tesla’s] biggest nightmare is the success of the electric vehicle market,” Bertel Schmitt, founder of the Japanese automotive news site Daily Kanban and an outspoken Tesla skeptic, said in an email. “It is beginning to wake up, and Tesla already is being rolled over by the global giants.”Tesla is the only maker of a battery-powered car that can travel more than 200 miles on a full charge, a feat accomplished by a very expensive pack of thousands of Panasonic’s “18650” cells that make up the floor of the Model S. That range is more than double that of any of electric cars on the market.Musk has said his master plan is to use the Model S to generate sales from wealthy early adopters to scale up battery production, lowering the cost of these high-energy packs. By 2020, he wants to be selling hundreds of thousands of sub-$40,000 Tesla Model 3 electric cars using cells supplied by its manufacturing plant that’s in the works near Reno, Nevada, under a partnership with Panasonic.But any success Musk’s company has in making low-cost electric cars will be challenged by long-established major auto companies that can easily outproduce Tesla.""]"

The automaker says the next Volt will travel 32 percent longer distances on battery power alone than the current one, from 38 miles to 50 miles.“We believe our engineering prowess combined with data from thousands of customers allows us to deliver the most capable plug-in vehicle in the industry,” Alan Batey, head of GM North America, said in a statement.\xa0This is the 2016 @Chevrolet Volt EV http://t.co/8ykux1sKlc #NAIAS2015 pic.twitter.com/zU4KYQeDLiâ€” SlashGear (@slashgear) January 12, 2015\xa0\xa0Volt sales declined last year by 19 percent and they represent less than a percent of GM’s total U.S. sales of 2.9 million units. But GM is betting that consumers will embrace plug-in hybrid electric cars as battery technology improves and public charging stations expand. Volt loyalists enjoy making short trips on electric power alone while avoiding the range anxiety -- the fear of running out of battery power midtrip -- that comes with fully electric vehicles that lack internal combustion engines. GM would like to see the Volt garner the same success as Toyota had with its Prius, first introduced in 1997 to become the world’s best-selling hybrid. \xa0\xa0Check out the new interior on the 2016 Chevrolet Volt #Chevrolet #Detroit #NAIAS2015 pic.twitter.com/pWa2dm6v76â€” Yazaki North America (@YazakiNA) January 12, 2015\xa0\xa0“The idea of an electric car without range anxiety remains a compelling concept, but the first-generation Volt couldn’t establish widespread support because of its short electric range, limited passenger capacity, less-than-stunning exterior shape and high price,” Karl Brauer, senior analyst for Kelley Blue Book, said in an email. “The new Volt will address all of these issues, giving it a real chance at Prius-like success for Chevrolet.”GM engineers managed to squeeze out 12 miles of additional range by building a two-motor drivetrain, shedding 100 pounds of weight, while boosting battery capacity to 18 kWh with fewer cells, saving 20 pounds.

The new Volt also gets a redesign and more interior room.Chevrolet also unveiled at the 2015 North American International Auto Show in Detroit on Monday its Bolt concept electric car. The Bolt is GM’s answer to Telsa’s anticipated Model 3 electric car. While Telsa says the Model 3 will get more than 200 miles of range for less than $40,000, GM is promising 200 miles of range for $30,000. Both cars are scheduled to be out in 2017.“I love the thought of a 200 mile ranged electric vehicle for $30,000,” Alec Gutierrez, senior analyst for Kelley Blue Book, said by email.\xa0“Sticker before tax rebates will be closer to $37,000 but this shouldn't matter since this will likely have a solid lease right out of the gate.

A €315 billion ($385 billion) European Union investment plan, announced Thursday, is the latest potential help. It aims to encourage investors to back projects around Europe needing financing including the startups that could bring new ideas to skilled but high-wage workers.The final production day at the Ford Motor Co.\'s plant in the eastern Belgian city of Genk came barely two weeks after the General Motors Co. closed its Opel Bochum factory across the border in Germany, both part of automakers\' strategy to adapt to falling sales following the eurozone crisis.""I worked at Ford Genk for almost 40 years, I\'ve never applied for another job in all my life,"" said Pierre Boonen, 57, after one of his last shifts at the plant that generated work directly or indirectly for about 10,000 people.

The decline comes amid an ongoing Tesla recall in Norway, analyst concerns that the company has overestimated its own sales and Wall Street predictions that low gasoline prices may cut demand for an electric luxury car.Shares have fallen by more than 25 percent since hitting a record high in September, opening at $209.38 Tuesday before climbing again to $211.25 later in the morning. Shares have dropped by 14 percent over the last seven trading days, a dramatic decline that has experts suggesting Tesla’s long-term predictions may have been too ambitious.The hastening drop has coincided with disappointing sales figures laid out by InsideEVs.com. The industry watchdog reported that Tesla sold 1,200 Model S vehicles in the month of November. That total was fewer than the two months prior and was seen by some as evidence that reduced gas prices, which have fallen to a four-year low of $2.66 per gallon on average, could change what a customer is looking for in a car. (Unlike other major car companies, Tesla does not release monthly sales figures.)“With the low oil prices, people will think ‘I can buy a normal car, it’s more beneficial that way,’” Ole Hui, a Hong Kong-based analyst at Mizuho Securities Asia Limited, told Bloomberg News. “There’s less incentive to go to electric vehicles.”Others aren’t convinced that potential owners considering spending between $75,000 and $100,000 on a Tesla are concerned about the price at the pump. Rather, it’s possible that sales were briefly down because Tesla is struggling to fulfill international orders out of a single factory in California.“We don’t think consumers are really penciling out gas savings in their purchase. More are buying the car for its performance, its reliability and for the brand,” Ben Kallo, an analyst with Robert W. Baird & Co., wrote\xa0in a note Monday, as quoted by Bloomberg. “Although the recent decline in oil prices has caused concern about [electric vehicle] demand, we believe EV purchasers are focused on the long-term benefit of not being exposed to oil price fluctuations.”Yet the fuel price fluctuation isn’t the only challenge Tesla is working to overcome. The company is recalling a batch of 1,100 Model S cars sold in Norway after discovering drivetrain problems created by inadequate greasing at the time of manufacturing. Tesla has previously said it will fly replacement parts to the Scandinavian country as well as hire more service workers to address the issue.']"

On top of that, the federal agency says it now expects to earn more than $5 billion from the program, according to a new report.The results offer a sense of vindication to the Obama administration and the program’s backers. During the 2012 presidential elections, Republicans seized on the failure of Solyndra and a handful of other clean-energy firms as examples of wild misspending and “crony capitalism” during President Barack Obama’s first administration. Energy officials maintained that the program, which began under the George W. Bush administration, was critical for advancing the types of cutting-edge technologies necessary for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and fighting climate change.Projects funded by the Loan Programs Office made $810 million in interest payments in September, according to the report released Wednesday. That’s higher than the $780 million in losses from loans it sustained when startups including electric-car maker Fisker Automotive, panel manufacturer Abound Solar and Solyndra went bankrupt after taking large government loans.""Taxpayers are not only benefiting from some of the world\'s most innovative energy projects... but these projects are making good on their loan repayments,"" Peter Davidson, executive director of the Loan Programs Office, told Reuters. “Every month money continues to roll in” from interest payments, he said, and losses aren’t expected to rise significantly.""We feel very confident that going forward our portfolio is much less risky than it has been,"" he told Reuters.Davidson took over the loan office last year after the program went 18 months without a permanent head. One of his primary tasks has been to revive the DOE initiative, which quietly operated under the radar in the years following the Solyndra debacle.The California-based solar manufacturer took $527 million in loan guarantees in 2009 to build cylindrical “thin-film” solar panels from a factory in Fremont. Two years later, it filed for bankruptcy, in part due to the plummeting price of Chinese solar panels, which made it harder for fledgling, less-proven technologies to survive. Despite all the political backlash sparked by that failure and others, the combined losses accounted for only about 2 percent of all the money issued under the program.    The federal Loan Programs Office issued a progress report on Nov. 12, 2014. Photo: Sarah Gerrity, U.S. Department of Energy  The loan office has seen a few high-profile successes -- chief among them Tesla Motors. In May 2013, the California electric-car maker, backed by Elon Musk, paid back its $465 million loan nine years early. Biofuels maker Abengoa SA, which got $132.4 million in federal loan guarantees, opened the nation’s third commercial-scale biorefinery in Kansas in October.The Loan Programs Office has the authority from Congress to issue nearly $60 billion in total loans and loan guarantees. The program has so far issued more than half of that chunk, of which nearly $22 billion has been disbursed to 20 projects.The $5 billion return it expects to earn exceeds those from many venture capital and private equity investments in clean energy, Michael Morosi, an analyst at Jetstream Capital LLC, which invests in renewable energy, told Bloomberg News.“People make a big deal about Solyndra and everything, but there’s a lot of VC capital that got torched right alongside the DOE capital,” Morosi said. “A positive return over 20 years in clean tech? That’s not a bad outcome.”']"

On Tuesday, the SpaceX co-founder said on Twitter that it was “still in the early stages of developing micro-satellites,” and promised that a more official announcement was coming sometime in the next two or three months.Musk says the micro-satellites will “operate in large formations,” and according to the Wall Street Journal, that could mean a fleet of 700 floating in near-Earth orbit. The newspaper first broke the story about SpaceX’s plans, reporting that each satellite could weigh 250 pounds, or about half of the smallest one currently in orbit.While the satellites themselves will be small, the size of SpaceX’s swarm also sets it apart: According to the Journal, it would be more than 10 times larger than any other fleet. The Internet provided by the satellites would be “unfettered … and at very low cost,” Musk tweeted in reply to a user of the micro-blogging platform.Musk is working with former Google Inc. employee Greg Wyler, who left the search giant in September. Wyler was ""key"" in\xa0Google\'s planned launch of 180 satellites, but left over concerns with its manufacturing abilities, the Journal reported, taking with him\xa0the rights to valuable wireless spectrum used for broadcasting Internet signals. Google largely relies on a number of third-parties for satellite imagery used in its Google Maps service, but acquired manufacturer Skybox Imaging in June.Silicon Valley tech giants are increasingly looking toward the skies to grow their user base.

But in the past couple of years, those shopping holidays have been dwarfed by China’s newcomer, Singles’ Day, which has grown to become the largest online shopping day in the world.Singles Day started as Bachelors’ Day in China in the 90s, celebrating men who were single, hence its date filled with numerous ones (11/11). While the day was traditionally celebrated through drinking and partying, it was transformed in recent years to a day focused on massive sales and discounts. Though the holiday is primarily celebrated in China, the world has paid greater attention to Singles’ Day as Chinese online retailers like Alibaba look to have a greater presence online and overseas.As retailers, couriers and consumers prepare for the big event, here’s what to look for with Singles Day 2014:Alibaba's Single's Day sales are already bigger than all of U.S. Black Friday e-commerce. Expect it to grow even more.Alibaba sales on Singles' Day are expected to grow 42 percent to 50 billion yuan ($8.2 billion) in 2014, up from 35 billion yuan ($5.75 billion) in 2013, according to China Daily. That’s a massive increase from Alibaba’s Tmall Singles’ Day 2009 sales, which brought in 50 million yuan ($8.16 million).By comparison, Black Friday ($1.94 billion) and Cyber Monday ($2.26 billion) combined only racked up $4.2 billion in U.S. sales in 2013, according to data from Adobe Systems.

This was just one of several comments the billionaire founder of Tesla Motors Inc. shared during the company’s conference call with analysts following the release of its third quarter earnings report on Wednesday.Aside from lauding Tesla’s use of Panasonic’s near AA-sized high-energy battery cells, Musk offered up a smorgasbord of details about the company’s current trajectory. He explained why Tesla is once again delaying the released of its highly anticipated Model X crossover, the justification for reducing the number of options available in the Tesla Model S sedan and addressed “upset” customers in China who have yet to receive the cars they ordered.One of the more important details of Wednesday’s earnings report is the Model X delay, and Musk said in the call that people ordering the car today won’t see delivery until early 2016. “The Model X is sold out for 2015,” he told analysts.Tesla reported a net loss of $74.7 million in the three months ended Sept. 30. But it met sales expectations with nearly 8,000 Model S cars, which seemed enough to pull the company’s stock price up nearly 7 percent on after-hours trading in New York on Wednesday, to $247. Investors rejoiced despite the company missing big on the number of cars it said it would produce in the quarter -- 7,200 units instead of 9,000 -- and announcing a third delay in the release of the Model X.Musk said he stands by his 50,000-car sales numbers for next year, which would be a jump from the 33,000 cars the company says it will sell in 2014. If Tesla could make the cars, he thinks he could sell 20,000 more of them.The company’s financials are strong, he added, pouring every dollar back into increasing capacity as its revenue nearly doubled from the same quarter last year. “We don’t see any near-term need to raise money,” Musk said. “Maybe not at all until the [Model] 3,” he added, referring to the sub-$40,000 electric car the company would like to be producing by 2017.Here are the main takeaways from Wednesday’s call:MODEL X DELAYOriginally slated for release in 2013, the Model X crossover is now scheduled for release in the fall of 2015. So what\'s the hold up? To hear Musk tell it, there’s nothing major to report. The company simply wants to get the car right at the mass production phase.“It would be quite easy to make a handful of production units [of the Model X] but that doesn’t really move the needle,” Musk said. “The question is at what point can we scale production to make a good quality car . . . It’s hard to engineer and hard to produce.”The Model X is designed so that adults can stand up fully erect from inside when the doors are open, allowing parents to more easily put their children in baby seats, or load groceries. And it’s this engineering feat -- namely how to mass produce it without flaws -- that\'s one of the hurdles.The bottom end of the car is sorted out, Musk said. What’s holding things up is “the falcon wing doors and second row seats and a few other things we’re adding, some new stuff that’s not out there.”REDUCING MODEL S OPTIONSIn an effort to improve production capacity, Tesla is reducing the number of Model S options. The high performance P85 will only come with the dual motor all-wheel drive option, known as the P85D, and the car will no longer be available in green or brown.“We had to make some tough decisions to have fewer versions of the Model S to ramp production better,” Musk said. The average sale price Tesla is making on its cars will remain unchanged, he added.Transaction prices will improve as sales of the P85D grows, says Chief Financial Officer Deepak Ahuja.THAT \'GIGAFACTORY\'The so-called ""Gigafactory"" Tesla is building in Nevada will not only produce batteries for the Tesla’s cars, but also stationary solar-power storage units that Musk believes is a vital part of a shift toward renewable energy sources. So how much of Tesla’s Gigafactory will eventually be devoted to this segment of the company’s business?“It’s pretty significant in the long term,” Musk said. “Thirty percent of the Gigafactory output would be for stationary storage.”One of the concerns express by skeptics of Tesla’s $5 billion Gigafactory is whether battery cell technology will overtake the cells the company wants to produce there by 2016. Musk says his plans include incorporating any innovations that take place. It can take about six years for a new innovation to make it from the laboratory to a mass production line, he says, so his company can anticipate and adapt along with any innovations that emerge.But, he said, he’s not aware of any current innovations that’s better than the Panasonic high-energy cells the company currently uses. What’s out ther is mostly speculation in the form of PowerPoint presentations rather than actual battery cell samples.“The battery industry has more BS in it than any other industry,” Musk said.JB Straubel, chief technical officer, took the opportunity to lash out at media reports criticizing the $1.2 billion incentive package the state of Nevada gave his company to build the factory at a site east of Reno, Nevada.“There’s a lot of press about the 1.2 billion dollar tax incentive package, that it was a bad idea for Nevada,” he said. “It’s a super good idea for Nevada ... We’re talking about the output of this factory being several billion dollars per year. The Nevada tax incentive is maybe a few percent of that.”“It pales in comparison to what Boeing got,” he added, referring to the aerospace giant’s $8.7 billion incentive in 2103 from the state of Washington.CHINATesla’s challenges in China are not just related to fulfilling demand but also in building out infrastructure, such as service support and charging stations. Musk says some Chinese buyers are “upset” for delays in deliveries of their cars. The company is holding back until it has the proper support infrastructure before it releases the vehicles to them.“The delivery experience has not been the way we like it [in China],” Musk said. “The Tesla infrastructure needs to be there to support it. Our China team is building it out faster than any region. But you can only do it at a certain rate and do it right.”Musk says the company has had conversations with the Chinese government about how it can be included in the country’s push to promote electric vehicle use in its smog-choked cities to lower emissions and reduce gasoline consumption. But will Tesla eventually make cars in China?“Essentially it’s not going to make sense in the long term to be transporting thousands of cars -- especially Model 3s -- across the Pacific,” he said. “It’s going to make more sense to do production there.”AUTO DRIVING AND CAR SHARINGMusk says self-driving cars are seven to 10 years away, which is in line with many industry predictions. “I think it’s’ quite likely that Tesla will be the leader in making cars like that,” he said. He envisions a car in which something “that looks more like a Nintendo controller or PlayStation controller” would pop out of where a steering wheel currently resides in the event that a passenger needs to wrest control of a self-driving car.Is he worried that car sharing will adversely impact the automotive industry?“I think there’s a limit to the whole car-sharing thing,” he said. “Most things don’t get shared. People could easily share their house, their clothes, their bicycles, but most people don’t.”']"

This is the fourth delay for Tesla\'s luxury electric crossover that was originally due out last year and was more recently rescheduled for the spring of 2015.\xa0Tesla reported a net loss of $74.7 million, more than the $38.5 million in losses in the same quarter last year as the company expands its global network of charging stations, prepares for the introduction of the Tesla Model X crossover, and invests in building its massive battery production facility in Nevada.\xa0The Palo Alto, California, car company said Wednesday in its third-quarter earnings report that it delivered 7,785 cars but manufactured significantly fewer Model S sedans than it had estimated in its second-quarter report. \xa0For Tesla Motors, financial numbers matter, but more important than anything is how many cars the company is selling and how many it\'s producing. The delay of the Model X means the company will spend another six months selling its sole Model S sedan and could impact the release of the sub-$40,000 Model 3 that\'s due out in 2017.The company cites delays in the production and delivery of its vehicles as a risk factor that could adversely impact its forecasting.\xa0Sales came close to meeting Tesla’s previous estimate of 7,800 for the quarter, up from 5,510 in the same quarter last year, but the production figures fell significantly short of the 9,000 cars the company said it would produce in the three months ending Sept. 30.“The ramp to our target production rate took longer than expected due to system integration challenges, reducing our production by almost 2,000,” the company said in its letter to shareholders released after markets closed in New York on Wednesday.Investors shrugged at the production figures. Telsa’s share price was up over 5 percent in after-market trading, to $243.11, after losing over 3 percent throughout the day ahead of the earnings announcement.Revenue for the quarter was $849 million, up from $430.2 million in the same period last year as unit sales continue to increase.

He tweeted that the company saw record worldwide (WW) sales.Article in @WSJ re Tesla sales is incorrect. September was a record high WW and up 65% year-over-year in North America.â€” Elon Musk (@elonmusk) October 28, 2014\xa0Musk took offense to the Wall Street Journal's use of a year-over-year sales estimate provided by WardsAuto. Unlike other automakers, Tesla does not disclose monthly or country-specific sales numbers.\xa0WardsAuto, an auto industry analytics and information provider, deduced from its research that Tesla delivered about 26 percent fewer Model S cars in the U.S. in the first nine months of 2014 compared to the same period last year, at 10,335 cars compared to 14,017.The Journal used the information to illustrate Tesla’s struggle to spur U.S. sales. If Model S sedan demand is falling it would be a death knell for a company that produces just one car.The incentive plan Tesla announced on Monday reduces monthly lease payments by as much as 25 percent, thanks to cost reductions provided by\xa0U.S. Bank, one of the company’s financial partners in its lease accounting. The news sent Tesla’s stock soaring over 9 percent in Tuesday’s trading, to $242.84, as it recovered from a three-month low.Tesla has always said that demand for the Model S is not an issue, but it has long contended that it suffers from supply constraints. Its deliveries are volatile as the company works from its sole Fremont, California, manufacturing plant to fill orders at home and abroad. Deliveries to Norway – currently the company’s largest market outside of the U.S. – shows the company is\xa0struggling to fulfill backorders. The company maintains that it has no problems with demands for the Model S.Musk’s 65 percent figure offers another way to estimate how many cars it sold in the U.S. last month.WardsAuto estimates Tesla sold 1,700 Model S sedans in September 2013, so a 65 percent increase last month in North America would suggest more than 2,800 cars were delivered, mostly in the U.S. This would likely make last month a sales record. \xa0As Tesla works toward becoming a mass producer of cars, it will face increasing pressure to act like one and adhere to an industry standard of providing investors a monthly update on sales. Until then, the media will have to rely on outside analysis for data, and Elon Musk will have to continue to use his Twitter account to issue corrections on data his publicly traded company doesn’t disclose.""]"

Forget ISIS and Ebola, the founder of Space Exploration Technologies and architect of the Tesla Model S electric luxury car said he thinks the development of artificial intelligence, AI, is “our biggest existential threat.”Speaking for over an hour at a Massachusetts Institute of Technology aerospace symposium on Friday, Musk called on governments to begin regulating the development of computing that could lead machines to autonomous cognition and decision making. This development could be like “summoning a demon,” he said.HAL 9000 would be “like a puppy dog,” Musk said during the 80-minute one-on-one with MIT President Rafael Reif. HAL 9000 was the fictional spacecraft computer in Arthur C. Clarke\'s “2001: A Space Odyssey,” who concludes that killing astronauts is better than lying to them.This isn’t the first time Musk, who has invested in San Francisco-based AI firm Vicarious, warned about the potential dangers of giving sentience to machines. ""There\'s some scary outcomes, and we should try to make sure the outcomes are good, not bad,” he said on CNBC in June.His comments came a week after Stephen Hawking, the Oxford-born physicist known to have significantly advanced Albert Einstein’s theory of general relativity, went on HBO’s “Last Week Tonight” to warn that someday machines could outsmart us by adding their own design improvement.""Artificial intelligence could be a real danger in the not-too-distant future,"" Hawking told “Last Week Tonight” host John Oliver.Watch the Elon Musk one-on-one here, or in the embedded video below:Watch the Stephen Hawking interview from earlier this year:']"

Investors will want to see progress in profit-margin expansion, which would indicate how well Tesla has done to bring down costs in its supply chain.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Tesla to eke out $3.5 million in net profit on $893.6 million in revenue, down from $15.9 million in profit on $602.6 million in revenue in the same quarter of 2013. Excluding one-time expenses, Tesla is expected to break even on earnings per share; including expenses, the company is expected to swing to a loss of 18 cents per share. In the third quarter of 2013, Telsa reported earnings of 12 cents per share, or a loss of 32 cents per share including one-time charges. \xa0Tesla will offer an audio webcast of its third-quarter earnings conference call featuring CEO Elon Musk here at 2:30 p.m. PDT (5:30 p.m. EDT).Now that speculation is settled regarding the planned $5 billion “gigafactory” battery production facility -- the company confirmed in September that it was building the site near Reno, Nevada -- investors will \xa0be looking for any indication of the company’s progress in China, considered a key global market, as well as progress in Europe, where the auto industry has been struggling for years amid the region’s economic woes.Tesla’s adjusted losses for the quarter are linked to its ongoing aggressive global expansion efforts, especially the fleshing out of its rapid-charging stations in the U.S., Europe and China. Last month the company installed its 200th rapid-charging station in the U.S., double the number the company had in May. Tesla also incurred additional expenses in the quarter when it announced\xa0it would expand its warranty policy to cover the drive train, which includes cars it has already sold.The company also shut down its sole Fremont, California, manufacturing plant for two weeks in the quarter to install new robots and expand capacity ahead of next year’s release of the Model X crossover. The company has been quiet about progress in developing the Model X, leading to speculation that the car might not be released in March as CEO Elon Musk said it would. The Tesla Model X release has been delayed two times already, in part because the company has been working on issues with the design of the vehicle’s unique “falcon wing” doors, which allow adults to stand up completely while inside the rear seats for easier groceries and child-seat loading. Any indication in the Nov. 5 earnings report of when the Model X will come out will likely impact Tesla's stock price.A third delay in the Model X would raise questions about the scheduled 2017 release of the sub-$40,000 Model 3. Tesla's business plan has always been to sell expensive luxury electric vehicles as a way to eventually build a mass-market electric vehicle with a range topping 200 miles per charge, or more than twice the rage of the current raft of lower-priced electric vehicles such as the Nissan Leaf.On Oct. 9, Tesla announced a new $120,000 premium all-wheel-drive Tesla Model S P85D with a searing 691 horsepower and 687 pounds-feet of torque and new driver assist option for all of the newly produced Model S cars. Investors reacted coolly to the news. The company’s stock price fell nearly 13 percent in the three trading days after the announcement, more than erasing the gains made in the runup to the unveiling. Some commentators pointed out that Tesla is simply playing “catchup” by offering all-wheel drive and driver assistance options that other luxury carmakers have been offering as pricey add-ons for a while -- think Audi’s Quattro\xa0or Mercedes-Benz’s Intelligent Drive.Tesla’s story is captivating fans of new technologies and electric cars, and the company’s share price reflects this enthusiasm. Despite the decline seen in the wake of the company’s P85D announcement earlier this month, Tesla’s stock has risen nearly 56 percent since the start of the year. The price gained a little over 1 percent in the third quarter ended Sept. 30. On Tuesday it was trading up 1.62 percent, to $234.19, well below its 52-week high of $291.42 touched on Sept. 4.""]"

The firm plans to release a similar analysis of the electronics behind the car\'s drivetrain and battery pack, due out early next year.\xa0IHS Automotive engineers spent about $20,000 on a wrecked Tesla Model S and took it to their El Segundo, California, workshop where they extracted and disassembled the vehicle\'s user interface. They spent weeks extracting and dissecting over a dozen electronic systems, starting first with the two digital screens on the car\'s dashboard.“We didn’t have a lot to going on in terms of where things in the car would be hiding,"" Andrew Rassweiler, senior director for materials and cost benchmarking at IHS Automotive, said by phone on Tuesday. ""It was a discovery process in a garage over two months.”What Rassweiler\'s team\xa0found was something rivaling the highest-end instrumentation and infotainment systems in six-figure German luxury cars. They counted more than 5,000 individual parts making up the electronics system.“Everything in this design makes the Tesla experience more like a media tablet or high-end smartphone than a traditional automobile,” Rassweiler said. “This approach required a major investment in big displays and touch panels, similar to the approach Apple took when designing the iPhone and iPad.”A systems this complex isn’t being made from scratch at Tesla’s Fremont, California, facility. The brain of this system is powered by California company Nvidia’s Tegra 3 1.4-gigahertz quad-core processor that channels ultra-high resolution graphics to a Taiwanese-made touchscreen helped by German-engineered integrated circuits and control units made in Austin, Texas.Despite the 17 major suppliers behind the system (see list below), IHS found that many of the printed circuit boards actually bear Tesla’s “T” trademark, suggesting the company conducted much of its own designs and engineering, something you would find in a tech gadget but is an unconventional approach compared to other automakers. The unusual size of the Tesla Model S touchscreen, for example, required the company to custom-engineer electronics to power it.“With this model, Tesla once again is behaving more like a smartphone or tablet seller than a normal carmaker,” IHS said in its report.Here’s a list of the 17 major suppliers of the key electronic components in the Model S identified so far:']"

The announcement is part of the ongoing collaboration between the Palo Alto, California-based luxury electric car company and one of Japan’s largest electronics producers to build the so-called Gigafactory, a lithium-ion battery production facility.“A new company, Panasonic Energy Corporation of North America, will be built in the Tesla Gigafactory,” the company said. “Panasonic plans to continuously expand operations meeting with Tesla’s vehicle delivery schedule.” The factory is being built at a site about 20 miles east of Reno, Nevada, after Tesla received a $1.3 billion series of tax breaks from the state. Tesla will not pay local or state property or business taxes until 2024 and is exempt from local and state sales taxes until 2034. \xa0Panasonic has worked with Tesla since 2007 and supplies the automaker with its 18650 high-energy rechargeable batteries. Each Tesla Model S vehicle battery pack contains thousands of the 2-inch-long cells. Telsa will need a constant supply of billions of these cells a year to meet its goals as it unveils the Model X crossover next spring and the lower-priced Model 3 by 2017. The Gigafactory will also build solar energy storage units for SolarCity Corp., the solar energy systems supplier founded by Tesla CEO Elon Musk.Tesla said in a regulatory filing released after markets closed Friday that the two companies have agreed to a production planning process for the $5 billion factory, a price for the batteries Panasonic will supply to Tesla and what Panasonic will spend in installing the manufacturing equipment at the site. Tesla is paying for the construction of the facility while Panasonic Energy Corporation of North America will make the batteries.Telsa’s stock price is up over 6 percent since Thursday, to $255.21, after Musk posted a message on his Twitter feed about an Oct. 9 announcement of what is widely believed to be a dual-electric-motor all-wheel-drive Model S.

Stock Rises As Elon Musk Announces Model ‘D And Something Else’,Thomas Halleck,10/02/14,12:24 PM,"['Shares in Tesla Motors Inc. popped nearly 5 percent Thursday after CEO Elon Musk tweeted that the electric carmaker has a pair of mysterious announcements coming on Oct. 9. Investors are eagerly anticipating Tesla’s sport-utility Model X as well as the lower-priced, mass-market Model S, but his tweets were about a “different” product announcement.""About time to unveil the D and something else,"" Musk tweeted on Wednesday night, along with a picture of a shadowy Tesla hiding in an industrial garage. Musk, the well-known entrepreneur, is known for making big announcements on Twitter as opposed to issuing press releases or leaking news to reporters.The Wall Street Journal speculated that the letter “D” refers to the ""dual motor"" that will be found in the upcoming Tesla Model X, enabling an all-wheel-drive system useful for areas that get a lot of snow. The Journal noted that Musk’s tease comes during the biennial Paris Motor Show, when a number of Tesla’s competitors are promising to offer electric versions of popular models.About time to unveil the D and something else pic.twitter.com/qp23yi59i6— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) October 2, 2014Musk himself offered little clarification in a later tweet, where he said Internet comments made him laugh, and he was glad he “didn\'t mention the other letter.” The other letter being the second part of Musk’s announcement, which means Tesla has two product announcements in the pipeline. Whether or not they are new vehicles, updates to existing models or something completely different is not clear.Tesla Motors had the best month ever for sales of the Model S, which 2,500 sold, surpassing a previous record of 2,300 in March of 2013. Sales so far in 2014 had not surpassed 1,800 in a single month, according to InsideEVs.com.Tesla also has so far has had “robust” sales in China, with upwards of 4,000 reservations so far for the Model S, according to Patrick Archambault. The Goldman Sachs analyst said that “industry sources” gave him the figure, which only counted reservations up until the middle of September. Archambault has covered Tesla Motors since its initial public offering in 2010. ""Model S demand in China is robust with wait times having expanded out to six months,” Archambault said. Employees are “working around the clock to meet increasing delivery targets.""Musk has said China could be Tesla’s biggest market in the future, with the country’s plans for zero-emission incentives weighing on top of high demand for luxury goods there. However, not all analyst are sold on a bright future for the Silicon Valley automaker. Richard Ross, analyst at Auerbach Grayson, told Yahoo earlier this week that he thought the stock could take a tumble.“I see further weakness here in the stock,” Ross said, prior to the market moves that followed Musk’s announcement. Tesla is up 57 percent so far in 2014, but “it’s really about the journey, not just the destination when we’re talking about momentum stocks like Tesla.”Tesla shares also dropped when CEO Elon Musk said the market had been overly “generous,” pushind shares too high.""I do think people sometimes get carried away with our stock,"" he said. ""I think our stock price is kind of high right now, to be totally honest. Or rather, let me put it to you this way: If you care about the long-term of Tesla, I think the stock is a good price.

Archambault projects Tesla would need to make 1.8 million to 3.2 million vehicles by 2025 to attain the company’s goals.But if the electric carmaker’s manufacturing goals aren’t met by then, the extra batteries the factory produces could wind up feeding one of Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s other businesses -- solar energy systems business, SolarCity Corp.    SolarCity sells Tesla energy storage units that are currently made at the company's Fremont, Calif., car factory.  Photo: SolarCity  Both ventures have their work cut out in similar ways. Tesla’s aim is to drive down lithium-ion battery costs to a level where it can produce an electric car at a cost that can persuade average-income earners to buy its upcoming sub-$40,000 Model 3, due out in 2017. To get there, most analysts estimate storage costs would have to be reduce to a third of the current $300 per kilowatt hour. Some are skeptical the company can get there on schedule.For its part, SolarCity is planning to build its solar manufacturing plant in New York that would rival Asia’s largest, SolarCity CEO Lyndon Rive said at a private event in New York last week. Eventually, Rive says, SolarCity aims to have solar panel capacity that would be 10 times larger than any panel factory in China, which currently dominates global solar panel manufacturing thanks to heavy subsidies. “Both companies’ manufacturing plans are ambitious but also risky,” writes MIT Technology Review’s Kevin Bullis, who points to numerous failed attempts by U.S. energy firms to kick-start a domestic solar energy market, event with U.S. government subsidies.In June, SolarCity bought Silevo, based in Fremont, California, the site of Tesla’s car factory. Silevo currently producs solar panels in China but has been planning a factory in Buffalo, New York. SolarCity, headquartered in San Mateo, California, is pursuing those plans.Tesla has been producing a small number of power storage units for SolarCity, and the new Gigafactory will supply some or all of the company’s needs. At the event last week, Musk said both companies are uniquely compatible. If more Americans embrace domestic and commercial solar energy collection and storage, Tesla and its battery-making partner Panasonic could provide SolarCity the storage units for any excess capacity coming from the Gigafactory.Musk says the Nevada plant will produce 500,000 battery packs a year for Tesla, so the company isn’t planning -- at least publicly -- to be a significant provider of storage units for SolarCity, but if Tesla doesn’t hit its production benchmark, the Gigafactory could become a more important player in solar-energy storage units. Considering Musk’s outsized vision for the future of energy, transportation and space travel through his SpaceX business, it wouldn’t be surprising if he’s planning to use the Gigafactory for solar energy storage more than anyone expected.""]"

Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz, Ford and Nissan are among the big players already offering some of these autonomous driving features — or are about to.So when Tesla Motors CEO Elon Musk recently offered up his prognosis for the technology, he joined the chorus. Most company executives have already said they expect autonomous driving to be widely available within 10 to 15 years. But the billionaire space-transport, solar-power and electric-car magnate is more bullish on how quickly the technology could be ready for consumers.The ability for drivers to let their cars do the driving could be ready “in a six-year time frame,” Musk tells the Wall Street Journal in a report published Thursday. But, he adds, it will take several more years for governments to work out the industry guidelines for wide embrace of the innovation.Nissan said last month it would have “commercially viable” autonomous driving in its cars in six years, so Musk’s comments echoing this time frame aren’t surprising. Tesla isn’t sitting idle on developing its own self-driving technology, either.Trip Chowdhry of San Francisco-based Global Equities Research observed on a recent tour of the automaker’s Fremont, California, factory that there’s a section called “Driver Assist” on the floor, suggesting that Tesla could soon unveil some self-driving features. The upcoming Tesla Model X crossover SUV would be an ideal candidate for these advanced safety features, like crash avoidance and self-navigation, because Tesla is marketing it as a family car. The Model X’s gull-wing doors, for example, are designed to allow parents to stand up completely in the back seat for more easily loading groceries or putting babies in rear safety seats.Earlier this week Morgan Stanley auto analyst Adam Jonas wrote in a research note that “the end of human driving” will happen within 15 years, a prognosis that includes the time it will take for regulatory hurdles to be overcome.That estimate coincides with what Peter Mertens, the head of research and development at Swedish automaker Volvo said in an interview with Automotive News last month: that “autonomous driving is going to happen in the next 10 or 15 years.”']"

Not only will competitors step up with improved longer-range, less costly low-energy battery cells to challenge the lower-cost Tesla Model 3, but the report predicts the car that’s supposed to bring Tesla to the masses will either get shorter range than expected or will cost more than the $35,000 price target Tesla is aiming for.\xa0“I used my best understanding to project the likely course of events in the next 3-5 years based on input from many industry veterans. Nobody can predict the future; we can just analyze the issues at hand,” Menahem Anderman of AAB told International Business Times in an email Wednesday.Anderman says in his report that it’s unlikely Tesla will be able to bring down the cost of its EV battery packs, which are measured in dollars per kilowatt hour, enough to deliver a Model 3 with more than 200 miles per charge (mpc). Most industry analysts believe in order to offer less expensive electric vehicles powered by these high-energy cells, the price needs to drop below $200 per kWh. The extended-range Telsa Model S is powered by an 85 kWh battery pack, which gives it 265 mpc compared to the Nissan Leaf’s 24 kWh with 84 mpc.Anderman, who correctly predicted years ago U.S. government efforts to stimulate a lithium-ion battery manufacturing industry in Michigan, says in his report that bringing the cost of electric car batteries below $200 per kWh is “unlikely before 2020.”If this assessment is accurate, Tesla will have to sell a Model 3 with a range of less than 200 mpc, or raise the starting price to $50,000, roughly the cost of a BMW 5 Series luxury car. “I wish Tesla proves me wrong and their success is larger than what my study forecasts, but I have provided in the study the most realistic, unbiased, expert assessment I could,” Anderman told IBTimes.Some of the more revealing observations from Anderman’s report:* Tesla won’t see battery cost savings from its Gigafactory until at least 2018, a year after the smaller, lower-priced Model 3 is due out.* Tesla’s battery pack design connects hundreds of small 18650 cells (pdf) interconnected with wires inside a rectangular aluminum case, which allows power to flow through even if individual cells fail. But on the downside, the complex wiring of four welding points for each cell “is unattractive from the standpoint of reliability.”* Within three years, automakers could produce the larger, low-power batteries (like the ones used in the Nissan Leaf and other small, low-range EVs) with as much as double the current range for the same price as Tesla’s packs within three years. “Most automakers only plan for an EV with 120-180 mile range,” said the report. A competing EV with a range of 180 miles per charge at a lower price would be a major challenge to Tesla’s Model 3, especially if it doesn’t top 200 miles per range, or come in at $35,000. \xa0* Tesla’s battery life will last 100,000 miles “in moderate climates” based on the assumption that most users will charge the car to 80 percent or less of its capacity, as recommended by Tesla. Climate extremes, say Anderman and others, reduce battery life. Tesla offers a warranty that covers batteries for up to eight years at unlimited miles.* Tesla’s total sales in China, where it began selling cars this year, could top 200,000 by 2020, but it would require Tesla to shift some production there. That move would skirt China’s hefty foreign car import tariff, but under current Chinese commerce law that would require Tesla to have a domestic partner.']"

The all-wheel drive option would make the car more appealing in snowy conditions.* Tesla is expected also to release a 400-mile range pack for its older Tesla Roadster that could be a test run for future range extension. The Model S has a range of up to 265 miles per charge. Tesla is the only maker of a mass-marketed, all-electric luxury vehicle, and it produces the only electric car with a range topping 100 miles per charge (mpc) under U.S. Environmental Protection Agency standards. Toyota’s RAV4 EV, which uses Tesla’s electric drivetrain technology, gets 108 mpc but is being discontinued due to lack of demand.* Tesla\'s sub-$40,000 Model 3 could be displayed to the public by this time next year.Musk said last week during his appearance in Carson City, Nevada, announcing his company picked a site east of Reno for its $5 billion battery factory that Tesla’s share price is “quite high.” This is the third time Musk has warned that Tesla shares are overheated since August 2013 when the share price was hovering around $160 a share.Shares rose more than 1 percent in afternoon trading Tuesday.

(NASDAQ:TSLA) will be exempt from property taxes for up to 10 years and from local sales taxes for up to 20 years, saving the company nearly $1 billion. Another $195 million in tax credits were also approved. One of the bills also allows electric car manufacturers, including Tesla, to sell directly to consumers, bypassing the need for a dealership.However, the tax incentives would hinge on Tesla investing $3.5 billion in the state in the next 10 years, failing which it will have to repay some or all of the money.“We are really excited to get going on this project,” Diarmuid O'Connell,\xa0Tesla's vice president for business development, reportedly said. “It means so much for our mission, which is to catalyze sustainable transportation by creating a mass market for electric vehicles.”The agreement also mandates that half the jobs in the factory should go to Nevada residents.

As summarized on pages 19-20 [of the report]: In the absence of revenue from Tesla, working families\' sales and property tax revenues will have to pick up the slack,” Greg LeRoy, executive director of Good Jobs First, a public accountability group, said by email on Wednesday.The economic impact report, produced by consulting firm Applied Economics in Phoenix, used “a widely accepted and utilized software tool that models the economic relationships between government, industry, and household sectors for a specific region so that when there is a change in any of these sectors, one can measure the effects/impacts that will happen to the other,” says the GOED.Now that the 44-page report on the estimated economic impact of the factory is out, the public has more information to go on. It will take years to know whether these projections turn out to be accurate, but here are the finer points:* Tesla (and it partner Panasonic) would operate the factory virtually tax-free for 10 years, but the study claims that in that period factory employees would pay $818 million in property and sales taxes.* As the chart above indicates, Tesla will be waived of paying school, local and state taxes and will only be billed municipal franchise fees for use of the local services, like drainage and utilities.* The 22,700 total jobs created by the factory would support 49,000 people, the report estimates.* The first three phases of construction would take place 2015 through 2017, supporting 4,600 construction jobs a year paying an average annual salary of $57,000.* Tesla would investing nearly $5 billion in construction, equipment and installation costs through 2018, supporting an additional 2,300 jobs a year to install the equipment inside the factory.* By 2018, the state says the project would indirectly create 16,200 jobs, paying an average of $59,000 a year.* Storey County, where the factory is based, and Washoe County, home to the Reno metro area where most of the workers would live, would benefit from $96.9 billion in economic growth over 20 years.* Tesla says the plant will be supported by solar and wind energy, but it’s still estimated to spend $139.4 million for electricity and natural gas over 20 years.']"

(NASDAQ:TSLA) to build a $5 billion lithium-ion battery cell factory east of Reno in the northern part of the state isn’t the first large corporate incentive package used to lure big business, and considering the trend since the Great Recession, it won’t be the last. As questions linger about how state officials came to their rosy projections of the benefits to the local and state economies, past billion-dollar-plus megadeals in other states offer a glimpse into the possible results of Nevada’s generous offer to the Palo Alto, California, maker of the Model S luxury electric car.Just days after Nevada briefly summarized the details of its proposed incentive package (pdf), Moody’s, the bond credit rating agency, said Monday the regional economic benefits of building the 5-million-square-foot factory would be so offset by what the state gave up that the region is “unlikely to see any direct fiscal benefits from the factory for at least the next decade.” The 20 years of sales tax exemption and three transferrable tax credits “will reduce the positive effect on state finances,” the note added.\xa0Critics of these megadeals have plenty of corporate incentive packages to study for their effects. In the late 1990s, Nissan Motor Co. Ltd. (TYO:7201) was shopping for a U.S. location to build a $930 million auto assembly plant. In 2000, Japan’s third-largest automaker picked Madison County, Mississippi, under a $295 million state subsidy package funded by borrowing. In ensuing years the Legislature approved expanding the incentive deal until it ballooned to $1.3 billion.Meanwhile, Madison County has been struggling to pay for the growing demand for services brought by the Nissan facility. The county is struggling to pay for education, roads and a wastewater treatment plant, according to a report last year (pdf) from the union-supported corporate accountability watchdog Good Jobs First. Nissan, the group says, is not paying what it should, which requires local and state government to either cut services or increase debt to provide what the community around the factory needs to support it.Nissan has also faced criticism for its use of temporary labor to reach the number of jobs the state expects it to maintain at a factory that produces eight of the company’s vehicles for the U.S. market, including its bestselling Sentra and Altima sedans.“Many of those jobs are regular Nissan payroll positions,” the report said. “The figures from the state audit show that around 20 percent are temps.” Good Jobs First estimates that the Nissan deal cost Mississippi taxpayers about $290,000 for each job it created, including about almost 1,000 temp positions that pay $12 an hour.The Mississippi Development Authority did not reply to requests for comment to these criticisms, but as its website makes clear, the agency hails the Nissan incentive package as a success story, focusing largely on the jobs the project created.""Nissan has more than met the requirements for job creation called for in the state’s incentive package,"" Justin Saia, spokesperons for Nissan North America, Inc., pointing to a Mississippi State University study on the effects of the Nissan plant. ""Our more than 6,000 team members hold some of the most secure jobs in Mississippi and enjoy competitive pay well above the state average for manufacturing jobs and strong benefits.""Nevada’s proposed incentive plan for Tesla promises 6,500 direct hires, but Martin Kenney, a professor at the University of California, Davis, who studies high-tech factories, thinks a facility like that would require only about 3,000 direct full-time employees.In some cases, these megadeals seem too generous for the economic benefits they provide.Houston-based Cheniere Energy, Inc. (NYSEMKT:LNG), for example, got a $1.7 billion incentive deal through the Louisiana Economic Development Authority to build a $6 billion natural gas liquefaction plant in southeastern Louisiana that the company says will create or retain 225 jobs, support 589 regional jobs, and utilize 3,000 temporary construction jobs. The plant is expected to be operational next year.Critics point to the high cost of tax abatement and the relatively low number of jobs the incentive ostensibly creates by luring an 18-year-old company that has yet to turn a profit but whose CEO, Charif Souki, is one of the highest-paid executives in the country. Cheniere employees were paid $1.7 billion in stock bonuses last year. In July the company was forced by shareholder outrage to withdraw a proposal to pay out $2 billion in stock bonuses this year. Meanwhile, as the executives reap huge reward for a company that has never turned a profit, Louisiana has sacrificed property tax and other revenue to attract the plant, which aims to export natural gas globally.LED’s website toutes the Cheniere incentive deal as a success story, offering the company a decade of property tax exemption on new investment and payroll deduction rebates. “With the support of LED and the congressional delegation in place, Cheniere was ready to embark on this new venture and capitalize on the new opportunity in the market,” the LED says, pointing to the future prospects of exporting natural gas globally.While public-private deals are common ways for local government to attract big business, create jobs and promote growth, in the wake of the Great Recession states have pushed the total value of large corporate incentive packages to historic highs, leading advocacy groups to warn that governments are spending too much in their efforts to attract big business.“Overspending on Tesla — or any other company — could be a net-loss game in which fewer public resources are then available for investments in areas that benefit all employers, such as education and training, efficient infrastructure, and public safety,” said a recent letter authored by a group of public budget advocates from the five states that had been vying for the Tesla factory.\xa0']"

(NASDAQ:TSLA) the largest corporate tax incentive deal in the state’s history, the public remains largely in the dark about the details of the $1.25 billion package aside from a\xa0two-page list of bullet points. The $5 billion electric-car battery ""Gigafactory,"" it says, will bring $100 billion worth of economic growth to the state over two decades, lower Nevada’s unemployment rate by two percentage points and create 22,000 jobs, including 6,500 direct hires.And yet with so little to go on except for a brief menu of benefits provided by Gov. Brian Sandoval to the media, the Legislature is expected to hold a special session next week to approve the deal even as critics from left and right are asking questions that have not been answered. Where, for example, did the $100 billion estimate come from? How did the state come up with the 22,000 figure for jobs growth? How did the total value of tax incentives mushroom from $500 million to $1.25 billion in just a week?“There’s no way of knowing how they came up with these numbers,” Philip Mattera, research director at Good Jobs First, a policy research group that tracks corporate tax subsidies, told International Business Times by phone on Friday. “Let’s hope lawmakers calm down next week and begin asking serious questions.”Jennifer Cooper, spokeswoman for the Nevada Governor’s Office of Economic Development, told IBTimes by email that the numbers come from two unnamed independent economic analyses.“Those reports will probably be available in the next few days,” she added. But with the Legislature widely expected to approve the deal in the next few days, that doesn\'t leave much time to find out how the governor’s office concluded that $1.25 billion in tax abatements and credits will yield an eightyfold rate of return ($100 billion) over two decades. \xa0There appears to be little opposition in the state Legislature to this math. State Sen. Don Gustavson, R-Sparks, who represents the district outside Reno where the Gigafactory will be built, told the Reno-Gazette Journal on Wednesday that he wanted “to see some numbers” and expressed concern that if Nevada was too generous to Tesla then other companies seeking relocation to the tax-haven state would want similar concessions.""I know that many of you are asking yourselves the same question: \'Is this agreement good for us?\' I can answer that today, and say emphatically, \'Yes, this meets the test,\'"" Gov. Sandoval\xa0said during Thursday\'s event in the captial Carson City announcing that Nevada was picked by Tesla for the location of the factory.If any significant opposition comes from next week’s special session, it could come from lawmakers from the southern part of the state,\xa0around Las Vegas, as they watch their northern neighbors benefit more from the deal.Most of the skepticism is coming from outside groups, like Nevada Policy Research Institute President Andy Matthews, who in a strongly worded letter on Thursday said Nevada was “betting hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars on an unproven enterprise.” “In contrast to the profound intelligence operating within free markets,” he continued, “government attempts to pick economic winners and losers are inherently benighted and unfair.”Leigh\xa0McIlvaine, a Portland, Oregon, based researcher for Good Jobs First who has been following Tesla’s efforts to extract the best incentive package from the five states that had been vying for the factory (Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada and California) says she’s skeptical about the number of people the factory will directly hire.“We’ve been hearing these reports that Tesla has been shopping around the 6,500 jobs number,” she said. “We’ve been skeptical of that number all along. It’s a battery factory. It will not have the same economic impact as an automotive factory because there are fewer suppliers.”']"

(NASDAQ:TSLA) has picked a site 17 miles east of Reno, Nevada, to be the location of its massive Gigafactory battery plant. The local architect had been offering up a regular rundown of local “Tesla speculation” as far back as February on his real estate development blog, and much of what he has said has turned out to be accurate. So what’s the climate in Reno now that the news is official?“It’s getting a big thumbs-up here. Everyone thinks that at 4 p.m. today their property values will go up 10 percent,” McGonagle told International Business Times by phone on Thursday hours ahead of the afternoon press conference in Carson City where Gov. Brian Sandoval announced a $1.25 billion tax-break package over 20 years. It's the largest deal of its kind in state history, significantly bigger than the $89 million Nevada offered Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in 2012 to build an iCloud data storage center near Reno.\xa0@elonmusk gets standing ovation #Gigafactory pic.twitter.com/eMHvbGOXwWâ€” Jack Bowers (@JackBowers) September 4, 2014The deal includes $725 million in tax abatements over 20 years and $195 million in transferable tax credits. The state would also be expected to allow Tesla to sell cars directly from its showrooms; most states prohibit auto manufacturers from selling directly to the public.“Tesla will build the world’s largest and most advanced battery factory in Nevada which means nearly $100 billion in economic impact to the Silver State over the next 20 years,” Sandoval said at a press conference in Carson City.The factory will supply Tesla with enough of the small battery cells used in its battery packs to produce 500,000 electric cars a year by 2020. The factory will directly employ 6,500 workers, but the state estimates a total gain of 22,000 jobs. \xa0Tesla’s decision to move to the Reno area is part of a long line of West Coast firms that have made Northern Nevada a domestic destination for companies seeking low-tax, low-cost locations to do business. Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) have had operations there for years, taking advantage of the zero corporate tax rate and proximity to Silicon Valley, and more technology-oriented companies, from solar panel manufacturers to a miniature drone developer, have moved in recently.McGonagle says 40 to 50 upscale homes have been recently scouted by Reno real estate brokers, presumably for the construction managers who will be moving to town to oversee the Gigafactory project. Local construction labor packed off for the oil fields of North Dakota and Texas in the wake of the 2007-09 Great Recession, and now Reno needs workers to come in for the 5 million square foot factory. Most of the workers will live in Reno, or in the nearby town of Sparks -- a nondescript suburb of strip malls and chain restaurants -- because there’s no housing at the Tahoe-Reno Industrial Center (TRIC) site, a cluster of undeveloped lots and industrial buildings just off Interstate 80.“There’s been a lot of Tesla [Model S sedans] in town with California plates over the last three to six months,” Eric Raydon, who moved to Reno during the recession to renovate blighted Reno homes, told International Business Times by phone Thursday. “We’ve seen a big wave of millennials here. Some of them are Apple people, some are Tesla people and others are in the vanguard of companies moving in here.”Part of that vanguard includes Ashima Devices, a manufacturer of miniature unmanned aerial aircraft, which announced last month it was moving its headquarters from Pasadena, Calif., to Reno. Last year, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) broke ground on its third data center near Reno to handle digital traffic for iTunes, iCloud and its App Store. Braeburn Capital, Apple’s asset management firm, is also in Reno, and Raydon says Wall Street firms have been scouting the area to set up data storage centers to complement their operations in New York and New Jersey.Minority Leader Pat Hickey on tax incentive package chances before the #nvleg: I think we'll get there.

Most expect the deal to pass easily as the governor enjoys a sky high approval rating.“We’re a little battle fatigued from the selection process,” said McGonagle. “At this point the legislature would offer their first born to get a deal through.”\xa0""]"

He said the company (NASDAQ:TSLA) has carved out an electric-car-market niche that it can defend. Here are some of the highlights of the note, by analyst\xa0James Albertine, with a hat tip to StreetInsider.com:TSLA appears to have carved out a defensible niche in the\xa0global market\xa0for luxury electric vehicles, and based on our recent tour of the Fremont, CA, facility, a sizable head start with respect to production.We believe TSLA is likely to further defend its already multi-year branding/production advantage relative to OEM peers chasing luxury EV share, and TSLA's Gigafactory will only augment its implicit battery cost advantage.We recently hosted a tour of TSLA's production facility in Fremont, CA, where it appeared the company remains on track (if not ahead of plan) to achieving a 1,000 unit per week production rate by year-end 2014.\xa0Given the pace at which production is ramping and the fact TSLA has only recently entered the EU and Asian markets, we are incrementally confident in management's ability to leverage its brand advantage globally over the next 2-3 years.We are raising our 2017 EPS estimate to $8.28 vs. $6.14 prior, primarily driven by (a) increased Model X pricing assumptions (now a $5-10k premium to Model S vs. a $10k discount prior), (b) modestly increased Model S/X output (111k S/X units delivered in 2017 vs. 98k prior), (c) 33% non-GAAP\xa0gross margin\xa0(vs. 30% prior), and (d) R&D expenses running at 10% of sales (vs. 9% prior) and SG&A expenses at 12% of sales (vs. 11% prior).TSLA sentiment is like a freight train, in our view, benefiting from a well manicured growth story that has caught the eye of a much broader investor base relative to most auto stocks.

Tesla spokesperson Peggy Yang confirmed to Bloomberg that China Unicom (HKG:0762) will provide Tesla space at its retail outlets to build 400 charging locations in 120 Chinese cities. Twenty of these cities will get Tesla’s fast-charge stations, known as “Superchargers,” as part of the deal. Financial details were not disclosed.“Each supercharger with four stalls costs about $150,000 to build, and that excludes the cost of land but includes cost of equipment, permits and labor,” said Trip Chowdhry, managing director for Global Equities Research in Redwood Shores, California, in an emailed statement Friday.

A little over a month after it returned to business, Trip Chowdhry, managing director for Global Equities Research, had a rare opportunity to tour the facility.“The second-floor space is huge,” Chowdhry told International Business Times on Tuesday, referring to the area of the plant where Tesla assembles its stationary batteries used for residential and commercial properties to collect electricity drawn from solar panels. Tesla CEO Elon Musk began selling these battery packs in December through another of his ventures, San Mateo-based SolarCity Corp. (NASDAQ:SCTY), located 26 miles from Fremont across San Francisco Bay. “It’s a low-volume business right now, but we expect it to pick up over the next 12 to 18 months,” Chowdhry added.Production of these stationary battery packs is a minor part of the company’s current operations, but it reflects Musk’s vision to expand use of renewable energy sources and, eventually, spur a mass embrace of zero-emission motorized transport. It's a vision that has many supporters.With the wheels back in motion in Fremont, analysts expect Tesla Motors Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) to increase production to about 1,000 Model S sedans a week by October, which would be almost double the capacity at the start of the year. Meanwhile, the company is still negotiating with up to five state governments on the location (or locations) for a $5 billion “gigafactory” project to produce at least 500,000 battery cells a year. Tesla says it has broken ground on a site east of Reno, Nevada, but maintains that California, New Mexico, Arizona and Texas are still being considered.Here are a few other observations Chowdhry made in a research note released Sunday.* No cash registers in the three on-site cafeterias, suggesting that the facility’s estimated 3,000 employees may enjoy the same free-lunch perks as Silicon Valley tech firm workers.* The second floor of the factory assembles stationary batteries in three power categories: 10 kWh for residential solar installations, 400 kWh for commercial use and larger packs for utilities. Tesla also produces electric motors, gearboxes, inverters and “various electrical components” in the same large second-floor space.* The recently expanded production capacity is now fully operational. The new capacity allows for weekly production of up to 3,000 vehicles, which means the company now has the capacity to begin building the Model X crossover, due out in the spring.* The factory has ample empty space to make room for the sub-$40,000 Model 3 due out in 2017.* The factory has an area sectioned off called “Driver Assist.”* Tesla’s factory lobby – where suppliers can come with their offers – was “busy with European suppliers and Asian suppliers,” says Global Equities Research. This compares favorably to last year, when there was “hardly any activity in the Tesla factory lobby.”“What Chevron is for internal combustion engines, the gigafactory is for electric vehicles,” Chowdhry said. “The factory will power the Model 3, Model S and Model X. It will also provide the stationary batteries and may also become a supplier to other electric vehicle makers.”Global Equities Research is bullish on Tesla’s prospects.

The policy, which could provide as much as 100 billion yuan ($16 billion) in funding, will be announced soon, two people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg News this week.Bloomberg said its sources asked not to be named because the policy discussions are private, and they declined to say how long the program would last or which types of electric cars could use the chargers.Fast and easy access to charging stations is seen as critical for the widespread adoption of electric vehicles. Most drivers are accustomed to pulling over at a nearby gas station whenever the tank runs low, so the idea of being stuck on the road with a dying battery and nowhere to charge has deterred many car shoppers from going electric.To combat “range anxiety,” automakers are investing in charging networks that would allow their customers to travel longer distances. California-based Tesla Motors Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) has installed more than 100 of its “superchargers” across the United States and about 70 in Europe and Asia, with plans to build more in the next year. The company\xa0announced\xa0last week that it would build a network in Australia to complement the rollout of its Model S luxury sedan in the country. Germany’s Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (ETR:BMW) said earlier this month that it was launching its own network of charging stations to make its i3 city car more convenient.News of China’s charging-station initiative follows a slew of central government policies aimed at increasing electric car adoption – part of China’s broader effort to reduce crippling air pollution in its cities and improve public health. Chinese carmaker BYD Company Ltd (HKG:1211), which is backed by U.S. billionaire\xa0Warren Buffett,\xa0said it has benefited from the government’s recent push.BYD’s revenue from “new energy” vehicles, including all-electric and hybrid-electric cars and buses, surged more than tenfold to 2.7 billion yuan ($440 million) in the first half of 2014, according to its Shenzhen Stock Exchange filing. The company said that 2014 “is a key year for the development of new energy vehicles,” and that it would look to “grasp this huge opportunity and promote the use of new energy vehicles both home and abroad,” Reuters reported.']"

The ad doesn’t disclose the identity of the Tesla owners who placed it, pegging them only as a husband and wife on Long Island, although more than a few Twitter users have speculated that Tesla’s marketing department is behind the gesture.Describing Musk as an “automotive visionary,” the ad thanked Tesla for introducing “fun, comfort and advanced reliability into a phenomenal driving experience.” Recommendations include automating the power-charging cap to close after the power cord is removed, bringing the cup holder forward, and installing a voice-activated dialing option that would make it possible for drivers to simply speak the numbers for any phone they wish to dial.“People are fascinated by my Tesla, and my wife’s Tesla,” the ad reads in part. “Promotion of your cars to the general public could only have a positive effect, creating many additional enthusiastic Tesla owners.”That request has already been satisfied, with Musk tweeting an image of the advertisement, earning thousands of favorites and retweets within hours.Ad taken out in Palo Alto Daily by two Model S owners is right.

So it’s no wonder Tesla Motors Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) made the country the focus of its global expansion plans early on.It’s been 12 months since the company began delivering its Model S sedans to Norwegian customers, and it looks like Tesla did well to focus on Norway.According to OFV, Norway’s automotive industry association, the California electric car manufacturer has sold an average of 436 Tesla Model S sedans a month for the past year, up from about 357 units a month last November. Since the car went on sale in the third quarter of 2012 the company has sold about 1,630 units a month in the United States.    Tesla's Norway sales have been volatile. One month deliveries are high, followed by a marked drop, thanks to production challenges. Photo: IBTimes  But as the chart above shows, the deliveries have been volatile. In January Tesla delivered 132 vehicles to Norwegian customers while two months later that volume jumped to nearly 1,500. This doesn’t mean Norwegians are buying Model S sedans at odd intervals. This chart depicts Tesla’s supply constraint in action.All Tesla cars are manufactured at the company’s Fremont, California, factory. Kits are then sent to Europe where final assembly takes place at Tesla’s Tilburg, Netherlands, facility. So while Tesla is busy filling orders in the U.S. and sending cars to Asia, it seems cars are being sent in batches to fill Norwegian orders.Norway is an ideal market for Tesla because of the country’s embrace of electric vehicles, the fact that it’s a wealthy country and because the government heavily taxes gasoline-burning luxury cars. Because the Model S is electric, Tesla can take advantage of a Norwegian tax regime that makes the Model S the least expensive luxury sedan in the market. At half the total price of comparable luxury cars like the Porsche Panamera S or the Audi S6, a Model S bought in Norway is a bargain.Tesla recently shut down manufacturing for two weeks in order to expand capacity, which is running at about 800 cars a week, according to the company’s recent financial statement.""]"

But here's where the rubber meets the road: The car has now been out long enough to be thoroughly tested, and the reviews so far have brought the early hype a little more down-to-earth.These so-called dependability reviews are important because they reflect how cars respond in the real world, after that new-car aura has dissipated. If the Model S doesn’t fare well in long-term dependability, its resale value will be negatively affected.“Given the number of bits and pieces Tesla has replaced on our car, it might be tempting to guess that its reliability score will go down. The reality is, it might,” ConsumerReports.org said in its review Monday of a Model S driven nearly 16,000 miles. Later this year the product tester will review feedback from Tesla Model S for its annual reliability survey. Last year, Consumer Reports gave the Model S the highest score of any vehicle it has ever reviewed.Monday’s review comes about two weeks after Edmunds.com listed a few issues of its own with a Telsa Model S driven more than 30,000 miles.“Our car amassed quite the repair résumé during the past 17 months,” Edmunds.com said.Defenders are quick to point out that Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)\xa0is constantly tweaking and improving the car, and that newer ones have corrected many of the issues experienced in older versions. In Tesla’s second-quarter conference call, CEO and founder Elon Musk blamed the issues identified by Edmunds.com on “our early production units.” Nevertheless, these are two of the earlier reviews of tested vehicles, and as the Model S ages, it will be judged against its luxury-segment competitors in overall reliability. Being an energy-efficient green machine against its gas-burning competitors will only take it so far.Here are the five main problems identified by Consumer Reports and Edmunds.com and how they were resolved:#1.) Problem: 17-inch center console touchscreen went blank unexpectedly, preventing access to most vehicle controls, such as opening the charger port cover. In another instance the touchscreen froze and was nonresponsive.Solution: Tesla service center trailer dispatched to pick up car. Tesla mechanics performed a “hard reset,” which fixed the problem. In the case of the frozen touchscreen, the screen was replaced. In other instances, a manual reset fixed the problem.#2.) Problem: Door handles, which rest flush against the doors, didn't protract, preventing access to the vehicle.Solution: Company contacted and sent out a wireless firmware upgrade.#3.) Problem: Front trunk lid didn't respond to a touchscreen command to open.\xa0Solution: Service center replaced front trunk latch.#4.) Problem: EV charger adapter that allows the Tesla Model S charge form various outlets came apart.Solution: Replacement part provided free of charge.#5.) Problem: Car stalled while being driven.Solution: Drive unit, high-voltage battery assembly and/or 12-volt battery and cables were replaced.\xa0""]"

(NASDAQ:TSLA) and its billionaire inventor Elon Musk have captured global attention for mass producing the world’s first luxury electric car that can travel more than 200 miles on one charge, the Palo Alto, California, company’s biggest challenge lies ahead: Producing a Tesla-like car for the masses. The question is how the company will be able to lower the price without cutting its range or trimming the high-tech options that have made the Model S such an attention grabber, and also what contributes to its luxury-level sticker price.The company says a sub-$40,000 electric car, the Model 3, is coming by 2017 and that it will have a “practical” range. That’s well below the $71,000 starting price of a Model S, not including the $10,000 battery upgrade or any of the options that put the car well into the price of a German luxury car.“A lot of people think luxury car buyers have higher expectations, but the people in the market for a $40,000 electric car are going to have certain expectations,” Joe Wiesenfelder, executive editor of the automotive pricing and data provider Cars.com, said by phone on Monday. “The question will be if Tesla can lower the price without shedding too many of the expected features. That will be another big challenge . . . But I wouldn’t bet against Elon Musk to figure it out.”The $5 billion so-called “gigafactory” that Tesla is planning (possibly near Reno, Nevada) with its current battery supplier, Panasonic Corp. (TYO:6752), will help the automaker lower the costs of battery pack production, but the main goal of the factory is to secure the company a dependable supply of batteries to produce 500,000 cars a year by 2020. How much that capacity will also lower costs is unknown. The production price of the individual lithium-ion cells used in the Tesla battery pack is less important than the cost of the battery pack, the cooling system and the electronics built around them.Tesla battery packs are the most expensive single component of the Model S, with current cost of about $500 per kilowatt-hour. This means about $30,000 of the price of a Model S is the 60 kWh battery pack that delivers 208 miles of range. Musk has said his goal is to reduce the kilowatt-hour cost by 40 percent, knocking about $12,000 off the price.But that cost savings alone will not be enough to provide a $35,000 to $40,000 Model 3 with at least 200 miles of range by 2017. To top 200 miles in range, the Model 3 will need to be smaller and lighter than the Model S and possibly carry a smaller, lighter battery pack.The other way Tesla can reduce costs is by cutting out some of the features available in the Tesla Model S. That would certainly be understandable; think entry-level Mercedes-Benz CLA250 compared to the premium S-Class sedan. Wiesenfelder says this is where Tesla needs to be careful because consumers are starting to be more scrupulous about standard high-tech features in regular, everyday cars – including touch screens with user-friendly interfaces, connectivity options and comfortable interiors.Tesla will have to produce a battery pack that can power a smaller Model 3 for at least 200 miles in range while at the same time offering many of the features that Tesla fans have grown to love.']"

And as the public slowly begins to embrace the technology, social media analysts\xa0recently\xa0looked at the online chatter to see which e-cars are getting the most attention.\xa0In comments on sites like Twitter and Facebook, the Tesla Model S predictably ranks as the most talked-about electric car on the Internet, according to the poll conducted by SAP SE (FRA:SAP), a German software developer and marketing analytics firm, and announced\xa0in Forbes on Sunday.    A recent analysis of social media shows that Tesla Motors dominates the discussion of electric vehicles, followed by the Nissan Leaf, BMW i3, Chevrolet Spark and Cadillac ELR. The Tesla Model X crossover, due out in the spring, has more mentions than the 13 other EVs in the global marketplace.  Photo: SAP/Lee Clemmer  Tesla Motors Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) and its founder, tech inventor Elon Musk, have managed to capture the public’s attention with the accolades-drawing Model S electric drivetrain, which delivers the longest range of any EV on the market. The company’s relatively recent placement on the stock exchange and its 700 percent rise in stock value since the Tesla Model S launched in third-quarter 2012 has helped fuel this chatter.Coming in second place is the world’s best-selling electric car, the Nissan Leaf, followed closely by the most recently introduced EV in the market: the i3, from Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (ETR:BMW). After that comes the Chevrolet Spark, which is offered as a conventional gas-burner and as an EV; and the Cadillac ELR, offered only as a plug-in electric vehicle hybrid (PHEV). After that, the SAP analysts found a considerable dropoff in online discussions.The Ford Focus Electric drew less online comment than even the Citroen C-Zero and the Fiat 500e. Cars like the Toyota RAV4 EV, the Mercedes B-Class Electric Drive and the bottom-ranking Renault Fluence Z.E. are getting hardly any attention relative to the most popular cars on the list. And their sales reflect this lack of interest. The RAV 4 EV is being phased out as Toyota’s relationship with Tesla in battery development is coming to an end, thanks in part to a souring of relations between Toyota and Tesla over differences in how the RAV4 should be engineered, according to Bloomberg. \xa0While a few EVs are attracting a lot of interest, they’re still barely a blip on the screen of total auto sales. While Nissan Leaf sales are up 34 percent in the U.S. so far this year, the volume is a low 15,755 units. To put that into perspective: Nissan has sold over 200,000 of its Altima midsized cars in the same period of time. Honda has sold less than 600 Honda Fit EVs and Honda Accord PHEVs in the U.S. since the start of the year.According to research firm HIS, EV sales (which include PHEVs) will grow 67 percent in the U.S. this year.']"

(NASDAQ:TSLA) has been on a spending spree as it ambitiously spreads its global footprint and prepares for the release of its all-electric Model X crossover. Fans of the Palo Alto, California, auto company founded by billionaire tech industrialist Elon Musk see a carmaker that has already won the electric-vehicle game.Accolades from Model S luxury sedan owners and reviewers abound, and all of this good feeling has lifted Tesla’s stock price by more than 700 percent since the Model S went on sale toward the end of 2012, to nearly $240 per share on Monday. But not since three highly publicized vehicle fires late last year (which were later ruled inconsequential) has the Model S gotten so much bad press.Criticism of the Model S isn’t likely to put much of a dent on Tesla in the short term, but as the car ages serious questions about the car\'s after-market value will begin to emerge — and become far more important than they are today.Under Tesla’s U.S. financing program, the company promises to buy back three-year-old post-lease cars for a guaranteed price. If the company cannot recover that expense in the after-market, it will have to report losses in future earnings.Due to supply constraints and the waiting list for deliveries, some owners have been able to sell used low-mileage Model S sedans for more than the price of new ones. But that quirk should vanish as Tesla is able to boost production to meet demand, and the reputation of used versions of the cars on the road today will be important to their resale values. \xa0Edmunds, the automotive pricing and car reviewer, listed a number of vehicle flaws in the $105,000 Model S, including a touchscreen that went blank more than once and three roadside stalling incidents.“Our car amassed quite the repair résumé during the last 17 months,” said the report authored by a number of Edmunds test drivers in some of the first long-term testing of the Model S by a major reviewer. Edmunds.com concluded that despite some “brilliant” features, including the vehicle’s famous torque, the car was “hard to recommend” because of the technical glitches and maintenance needs. It was the first major negative review of the Model S since the New York Times gave the car a thumbs-down in February 2013, which elicited a bullet-point-laden response from Musk himself.TrueDelata.com is also showing a poor repair record for older Model S sedans, albeit on a small sample set because so few older Model S cars are out there. Out of 35 records, 19 have been brought in for repairs, ranging from a rear door that spontaneously opened in a Model S with 17,000 miles in Missouri in September 2013 to a replacement of the main battery pack in a California-based Model S with 49,000 last month.In his conference call last Thursday, Musk reacted to the Edmunds review, suggesting his technical repair teams are taking an “ultra-proactive” approach to cars requiring maintenance, swapping out components for newer ones. Tesla, he says, is constantly tweaking and improving the vehicle, and flaws in early cars have been fixed in vehicles making their way to showrooms today.Carter Driscoll, a clean-tech analyst with New York-based investment banking firm MLV & Co., told International Business Times that Tesla’s novelty in the marketplace means it’s been working out kinks as it builds a car from the ground up.“They’re improving the way the Model S modules are packaged and produced, including adjustments in the supply chain,” said Driscoll. “The car is vastly superior to what it was in the third quarter of 2012,"" when the first Model S cars went on sale.Tesla vs. Lamborghini: Tesla Gets SmokedThe Model S is still overall considered an innovative car. It’s the first electric sedan ever produced that can top 200 miles in range. The vehicle’s torque is borderline legendary. With a direct line to the powertrain, the full force of the car’s power is felt immediately when the pedal is pressed. But as this video shows, it has a long way to go to reaching the performance of high-end (and far more expensive) sports cars. Here you can see the Tesla pulling ahead quickly from full stop against the Lamborghini Gallardo LP570-4, but then the Italian racer catches up and quickly surpasses the Model S.But considering that only about 14,000 Gallardos were ever produced, and that when they were available they cost more than two loaded Model S sedans, this is an unfair race. Nevertheless it does deflate some of the hubris bouncing around the Tesla fan blogs about the vehicle’s impressive torque.[Read the Drag Times article here about the Tesla-Lambo faceoff.]']"

But blame for Saturday’s factory explosion in Kunshan City, China, isn’t likely to be laid at GM’s doorstep.The issue underscores not only GM’s relationship with its massive web of partners and suppliers in the world’s largest auto market but also raises questions about the safety of China’s factory supply chain and how much responsibility foreign companies like GM, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and McDonald’s Corp. (NYSE:MCD) have to share for problems in their multi-tiered supply chains.General Motors Co. (NYSE:GM) acknowledged on Sunday that Zhongrong Metal\xa0Products Co. was a so-called “Tier-2” supplier, meaning the company produced its aluminum alloy wheel hubs and then passed them to GM’s “Tier-1” provider, CiTiC Dicastal Wheel Manufacturing Co., Ltd., based in Qinhuangdao city.""We are working with our supplier to establish alternate processing capability,"" GM told Reuters after the accident, which killed at least 75 workers and injured at least 186. The company said it had no direct dealings with Zhongrong, where workers had been complaining about dangerous buildup of metal dust in the air.If enough aluminum dust builds up in the air of a confined workplace, it can easily ignite when it comes in contact with any source of fire, such as an electric spark from a machine or the flame from a cigarette lighter. The U.S. Chemical Safety Board advises workplaces with a high level of combustible particles in the air to have adequate ventilation and protective gear.Combustible air particles from many types of materials – including aluminum, magnesium, coal dust and even wheat flour – are common industrial hazards in China and worldwide. In 2011, a similar metallic-dust explosion killed 16 workers at a Foxconn plant manufacturing parts for Apple’s iPad 2.In a remarkably similar incident to Saturday’s accident, an aluminum-dust buildup caused an explosion at a plant making aluminum alloy automotive wheels\xa0that killed one worker in Huntington, Indiana, in 2003.Labor rights groups have argued that companies should be responsible for safety across their supply chains, be they in China or in the United States. The use of multi-tiered supply chains has been one of the main issues in a series of garment factory accidents in Bangladesh.""Safety measures like ventilation systems should have prevented such accumulation of dust particles. This tragedy is a result of lax safety standards in the workplace,"" said New York-based China Labor Watch, which contends that GM shares responsibility for this accident.McDonald’s and other fast food companies recently faced their own supply chain problems in China when they discovered a major local meat supplier was providing expired beef and chicken.\xa0General Motors has a big presence in China – second only to Volkswagen AG (FRA:VOW3) – and GM sells more vehicles there than in the United States. The company’s Chinese supply chain is massive and connected to its primary local vehicle manufacturing partners. GM has 10 joint ventures in China, including three with local car companies, underscoring the intertwined nature of the Chinese automotive sector.Shanghai GM is the company’s largest Chinese operation. It produces several Buick, Cadillac and Chevrolet vehicles with Shanghai Automotive Industry Corp. Group (SAIC), China’s largest state-owned domestic car company. SAIC-GM-Wuling Automobile manufactures Wuling light trucks and vans and the new Baojun 730 family van released last week in China. The company also partners with FAW, China’s third largest domestic automaker under FAW-GM Light Duty Commercial Vehicle Co. Ltd.\xa0In an interview with International Business Times in June about Tesla Motors Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) and other companies working to weed out conflict minerals from their supply chains, Maisam Abbasi, an industrial engineer at Sweden’s Lund University who specializes in sustainable supply chain logistics, said bringing together producers and suppliers across a global, multi-tier supply chain is a good first step toward sustainability and ethical sourcing practices.']"

The jobs growth, which came in below economists\' forecasts, relieved some investors worried about how soon the Fed could bump up interest rates after data on Thursday showed U.S. labor costs recorded their biggest gain in more than 5-1/2 years in the second quarter. But concern remained over Argentina\'s debt problems after the country\'s default earlier this week. A U.S. judge on Friday criticized Argentina\'s decision to default and ordered negotiations between the country and holdout investors to continue. ""Anytime a country defaults on its debt, it\'s usually an unnerving event in the market. The risk-aversion people sell risky assets,"" said Natalie Trunow, chief investment officer of equities at Calvert Investment Management in Bethesda, Maryland. But Trunow said the market dips should be seen as buying opportunities. ""I don\'t think we\'re anywhere near the end of the expansion cycle."" Seven of the 10 S&P 500 sectors ended lower, with S&P financials .SPSY among sectors with the biggest losses.

[VIDEO],Jessica Menton,08/01/14,2:15 PM,"['Tesla Motors Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares rose more than 6 percent in afternoon trading Friday after the electronic car maker reported fiscal 2014 second-quarter earnings of 11 cents a share, excluding items, on revenue of $858 million, compared with earnings of 2 cents a share on sales of $551.95 million a year earlier. The company posted earnings 7 cents above analysts’ estimates as revenue also topped forecasts.Wall Street expected Tesla on Thursday to report earnings of 4 cents a share after the closing bell, excluding items, on revenue of $810.57 million, according to analysts polled by Reuters.“We have had an active first half of 2014, and the rest of the year is expected to be even busier,” Tesla said in the company’s second-quarter earnings statement. “Provided that we execute well and there are no serious macroeconomic shocks, Tesla’s annualized delivery rate should exceed 100,000 units by the end of next year.”After the markets closed Thursday, Tesla posted a wider loss than expected as profits fell $61.9 million during the quarter (on a GAAP basis), or 50 cents a share, as revenue rose to $769 million. The company lost $30.5 million, or 26 cents a share, on revenue of $405.1 million during the same year-ago quarter.Tesla stock opened Friday’s session at $226.09 a share and rose as high as $237.50 in afternoon trading. The company closed Thursday’s session down 2.5 percent at $223.30 in regular trading ahead of the earnings report. Investors were mixed in after-hours trading, as the stock rose about 1 percent following the announcement, but then reversed trend and fell nearly 2 percent. The stock then climbed again after Elon Musk, chairman and chief executive officer of Tesla, spoke with analysts during the company’s second-quarter earnings call. Shares rose over 1 percent in pre-market trading on Friday.“This stock almost doubled between the month of November and February of this past year,” Mark Newton, chief technical analyst at Greywolf Execution Partners, told IBTimes. “It went from around $120 to nearly $260. It’s since been consolidating. If you look at the options market, the volatility is up about 20 points from where the back month is. So it’s trading at about 60 percent volatility. In this tight range it is anticipating that we could see a big move for Tesla and potentially a breakout at this bigger triangle.”Tesla said the company had $2 million net cash outflow from operations in the second-quarter, primarily due to an $82 million increase in finished goods inventory from cars in transit to Europe and China, and $15 million of cash used for leasing vehicles. Capital expenditures in the quarter totaled $176 million.“I’m looking at $209 to $214 as being area on the downside, and that’s right near July lows,” Newton said. “It also hits a bigger trend line, so it’s a five-point range of support. If it gets below there, we have the potential of seeing real weakness.”Model S Production and Model X Development\xa0Tesla announced a new Model S/Model X assembly line planned to begin operation next week. The company hit a second-quarter record and delivered 7,579 Model S vehicles and built 8,763 cars during the period. The company said it is “on track” for more than 35,000 deliveries in 2014.In addition, Tesla is expanding its Supercharging network, with the introduction of Supercharger stations in Canada and a substantial increase in the rate of deployment in Europe and China. Globally, the company just energized its 156th Supercharger station.“In June alone, the Supercharger network passed a milestone, delivering more than 1 GWh of energy to Model S vehicles in the month, representing 2.7 million miles of driving,” Tesla said. “Since inception, our customers have driven for free nearly 32 million Supercharged miles, the same distance as traveling to the moon and back, 65 times.”The company said development efforts remain on track for production of its SUV Model X in the spring of 2015 and anticipates having operational alpha prototypes ready by next week “in order to confirm design intent and beta prototypes to be ready later this year.”Tesla and Panasonic Announce Gigafactory AgreementTesla announced plans in February to build a $5 billion battery “Gigafactory” designed to reduce cell costs and, by 2020, produce more lithium ion batteries annually than were produced worldwide in 2013. The company had not yet announced where the factory would be located until Thursday.Ahead of the company’s earnings release, Tesla announced a partnership with Japanese electronics company Panasonic Corporation (OTCMKTS:PCRFY) to build the “Gigafactory” in the United States. Musk said in a letter to shareholders that site preparation has started for a location that could be used for the factory, which is expected to open in 2017.“In June, we broke ground just outside Reno, Nevada, on a site that could potentially be the location for the Gigafactory,” Musk said. “Consistent with our strategy to identify and break ground on multiple sites, we continue to evaluate other locations in Arizona, California, New Mexico and Texas.”Panasonic will invest in production equipment that it will use to manufacture and supply Tesla with battery cells, while the automaker will prepare and provide the land, buildings and utilities for the “Gigafactory,” invest in production equipment for battery module and pack production, and be responsible for the overall management of the large-scale factory.Expanding Model S Demand in China, EuropeTesla said the number of deliveries in a quarter is influenced by three main factors: the company’s ability to increase production, the allocation of that production among its North American, European and Asian markets, and the automaker’s need to fill the in-transit pipeline for future deliveries in each region.“The one thing to look for is China because they’re a huge consumer, obviously, and I think the deal with Panasonic also with this battery plant has to be considered a positive as well,” Newton said.Tesla is “doubling its total global addressable market this year” by entering China and the right hand drive market. The automaker is delivering cars only in the areas around Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen and recently Hangzhou and expects to launch service and deliveries in additional cities in the coming months, including Chengdu and Guangzhou.“You saw some real signs of slowdowns and real guiding down of their earnings over the last few months, and that’s a little bit of a concern, but their revenues and I think the amount of cars they’ve been able to ship to China and Hong Kong, all these new markets that have opened up, is definitely encouraging,” Newton said.The right hand drive Model S launched in the United Kingdom in June and in Hong Kong last week, and Tesla expects to begin deliveries in Japan and Australia later this year.Forward-Looking GuidanceTesla said it plans to produce about 9,000 cars in the third-quarter, including the effect of the two-week production shutdown related to the transition to the new final assembly line at the Fremont, California, factory.The company expects to deliver around 7,800 Model S vehicles during the period.“We plan to invest between $750 million and $950 million in 2014, an increase of $100 million from prior guidance,” Tesla said. “We continue to invest in additional production capacity, continued Model X and Model S development, Gigafactory construction, and further expansion of our sales, service, and Supercharger footprints.”Non-GAAP automotive gross margin in the current quarter is expected to be consistent with the prior quarter and the automaker estimates to lease about 300 cars in North America during the period.Shares of Tesla Motors rose over 6 percent on Friday to $237.50 in afternoon trading.\xa0“My thinking is we should see above average positivity in this stock just given the tight range it’s traded over the last few months,” Newton said. “So I’m looking for a breakout.”']"

Earlier in the day, Tesla announced it had signed an agreement with Panasonic Corporation (TYO:6752) on the factory. The deal would see the Japanese electronics giant producing the lithium-ion cells while Tesla would locate, build and maintain the facility.""By building its own battery facility, Tesla can take full control of its battery supply and eliminate that restraint, a shift that could mesh effectively with increased global distribution and demand from China,"" Karl Brauer, senior analyst at automotive pricing and information provider Kelley Blue Book, said in an email. \xa0    Tesla confirmed Thursday that it was breaking ground ""just outside of Reno, Nevada.""

But automakers still face major hurdles in moving these alternative models, including high costs and consumer anxiety.Nearly 50,000 plug-in vehicles were sold in the European Union in 2013, up from 22,000 in 2012, according to an analysis of official data by the Transport & Environment (T&E) advocacy group, the Guardian reported. Renault’s Zoe, Volvo’s V60 plug-in and Mitsubishi’s Outlander together comprised nearly half of last year’s sales, or about 8,000 models each.The leading models in 2012 – Opel’s Ampera and Puegeot’s Citroen iOn/C-zero – meanwhile saw their sales drop sharply. “What you are seeing is better cars and better services being offered to the market,” Greg Archer, the clean vehicles program manager at (T&E), told the Guardian.Overall, electric vehicles accounted for about 0.4 percent of new car sales in Europe last year. In the United States, by comparison, 0.6 percent of total passenger car and light truck sales in 2013 were plug-in models – about 96,000 vehicles.“Electric cars are growing strongly, but at the same time the simple truth is that they are too expensive for most people to consider,” Archer told the Guardian. Volvo’s V60 plug-in, for instance, cost from £44,275 ($75,000) after a £5,000 ($8,500) UK government subsidy, while Mitsubishi’s Outlander priced at about $47,800 after subsidy and Renault’s Zoe cost around $24,000 after subsidy.U.S. car buyers can obtain federal tax credits worth up to $7,500 when they buy a plug-in model, and some state governments offer additional incentives. Tesla Motors (NASDAQ: TSLA)\'s\xa0Model S luxury sedan is priced from $71,000 domestically, while the all-electric Nissan Leaf and plug-in hybrid Chevy Volt each cost around $30,000.Still, Archer said such government subsidies aren\'t sustainable in the long-run, and that a more effective way to get automakers to produce electric cars would be to force them to slash greenhouse gas emissions across their entire fleet. In the United States, car manufacturers are now required to nearly double the average fuel economy of new cars and trucks by 2025, to 54.5 miles per gallon, but automakers in Europe are resisting attempts to adopt emissions standards on the continent, the Guardian noted.Transportation accounts for about one-fourth of total emissions in Europe and one-third of emissions in the United States.Archer said that while electric vehicles are important for reducing transportation pollution, improvements in diesel and gas-powered cars are even more critical in the near-term. ""We will not see large numbers of electric cars on the roads for a decade, so we need to see other steps as well,"" he said.']"

(NASDAQ:GOOGL) has been developing its own robotic driving technology since the fall of 2010. Since then, virtually every major auto manufacturer has begun its own driverless experiments.Following the lead of California and four other U.S. states, which have passed laws permitting driverless cars on public roads, Britain is moving forward with its own policy to promote the technology.Business Secretary Vince Cable issued a statement Wednesday announcing a government initiative to fast-track the adoption of driverless cars.“Today’s announcement will see driverless cars take to our streets in less than six months,” Cable said.British cities can now bid for funding to host local driverless car trials as part of a $16.9 million program folded into a broad infrastructure development plan announced in December. This week’s announcement offers more details.Three cities will be selected to host driverless car trials starting in January. These trials will test what the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration calls Level 3 and Level 4 autonomous driving. Level 3 automation allows drivers to cede most command of the vehicle, but they must remain at the wheel for some control. Google’s earlier driverless vehicles were Level 3, but earlier this year the company debuted a Level 4 driverless car, which requires no human intervention and doesn’t even have a steering wheel.The British initiative will hold trial runs for up to 36 months in the three selected cities while the government reviews road regulations “to establish how the U.K. can remain at the forefront of driverless car technology,” said Wednesday’s announcement. Cities have until Oct. 1 to submit their bids for the program to the government’s Technology Strategy Board. \xa0Last summer, Oxford University announced it would use Nissan cars to test autonomous driving on U.K. roads. Nissan Motor Co. Ltd. (TYO:7201) is already testing its version of the technology on Japanese roads and says its automated cars could be in production as early as 2020. Google says its self-driving car technology will be available to the public in 2017. Tesla Motors Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk has said his Model S sedan and Model X crossover (due out next spring) would be ready for autonomous driving options by 2016.General Motors Co. (NYSE:GM), Toyota Motor Corporation (TYO:7203) and Volkswagen-owned Audi AG (ETR:NSU) are all working on fully autonomous cars for the mass market.Many of the features required for semi-autonomous or fully autonomous driving are already in cars on the market today, such as the sensors required for cars to autonomously brake faster than the human driver can react when a collision is imminent.']"

More details on the project are expected after markets close in New York on Thursday, though it’s not certain Tesla is ready to announce the location of the 10-million-square-foot factory. Indeed, the company has even said there would be two sites, but whether than means they will be adjacent or located in different states is subject of even more speculation.Earlier this month, Tesla was reportedly scoping out a 700-acre location in southern Dallas County, Texas, according to the Dallas Morning News. But Tesla has kept quiet as to any specifics beyond saying the projects would be built somewhere in Texas, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico or California. Until the news from Dallas broke, most reports said San Antonio would be the most likely location if Tesla Motors Co. (NASDAQ:TSLA) picked Texas.California is least likely to win the deal because of the high cost of setting up a factory there relative to the other states. (Tesla’s plant in Fremont, where the Model S is produced, has been an auto-manufacturing site since 1916, so the company didn’t have to set it up from scratch.) But the Legislature has moved to stay in the running. Gov. Jerry Brown signed into law this month a bill that would give Tesla property tax credits if it chose California.""California has re-entered the race and closed the gap with the other states,"" Tesla spokesman Simon Sproule told USA Today last week. \xa0East of RenoA site east of Reno, Nevada, has been the subject of a lot of chatter in recent months. Last week, Nevada-based electric car enthusiast Bob Tregilus traveled to the location at the Tahoe-Reno Industrial Center, 23 miles east of Reno, where he found a guarded site where workers were leveling ground in what appeared to be a major addition to the industrial park. But on Friday, Transport Evolved, which ran Tregilus’s piece, said the site “has been either temporarily or indefinitely closed.”“My husband, nephew and a couple friends were all working on that project 12-hour days, seven days a week, for the last month on it,” a woman who identified herself as a local resident, and who claims Tesla was behind the project, told the website by email. “All the people I know who were working on the project were let go today. I truly wish it wasn’t true, we need those jobs.”But later on Friday, the local NBC affiliate scotched the rumor that the site was shut down. \xa0“They\'ve reached the end of the first phase,” Lance Gillman, director of the Tahoe-Reno Industrial Center, told News 4. “And so I can tell you that there\'s been a full mile-long path built in about three and half weeks. And so the first phase of construction process is completed and there is a halt at this time.”Gilman said a nondisclosure agreement between the contractors and the client prevents him from confirming or denying that Tesla is behind the project.The location would be ideal for a number of reasons, mainly because it’s only 236 miles from Tesla’s Fremont factory. Nevada has a lot of spare land, too, making the site a relative bargain. There’s also a lithium mine nearby operated by Rockwood Holdings Inc. (NYSE:ROC). Lithium is a key mineral ingredient in batteries.One other bit of circumstantial evidence that the site could be located east of Reno has come from real estate blog REreno, which said local contractor F&P Construction, which holds the excavation permit to level the ground at the site, began an unprecedented local television ad campaign seeking job applicants. The blog also claims Yates Construction was interviewing for local applicants recently. Yates built a battery plant for Nissan Motor Co. Ltd. (TYO:7201) in Smyrna, Tennessee, where the best-selling electric car, the Nissan Leaf, is built for the North American market.Tesla’s stock jumped 2.7 percent to $229.60 in afternoon trading in New York after Japan’s Nikkei news service announced that Tesla and Panasonic Corp. (TYO:6752) came to an agreement on the battery factory. Panasonic is Tesla’s battery provider and had previously announced it would be a partner with Tesla in boosting battery production. Neither company confirmed the deal as of Monday afternoon. Panasonic’s U.S.-listed stock was up 1.39 percent to $12.37 in New York.\xa0']"

Mobile ad revenue comprised nearly 80 percent of total ad revenue.“With Twitter, they may not have revenue and they may not have positive earnings for the quarter, but I’m not sure that’s important right now,” Bliss said. “People are buying the stock based upon what the future is. Right now, since it’s pulled back 59 percent from the highs, depending upon what they say in their earnings announcement about ad revenue, it might be a good time to go ahead and take a shot prior to that earnings call and get into this stock.”Despite beating analysts’ expectations during the first-quarter, shares of Twitter dropped more than 10 percent in after-hours trading following its last earnings announcement\xa0in April as analysts were looking for a larger boost in monthly active users.Twitter reported an average of 255 million monthly active users during the first-quarter ended March 31, a 25 percent year-over-year increase as mobile monthly active users hit 198 million during the period, an increase of 31 percent from a year earlier. However, the increase to 255 million active users for the last quarter was just 14 million higher compared to three months earlier when Twitter reported 241 million active users in the fourth-quarter of 2013. \xa0Meanwhile, rival Facebook Inc. (NASDAQ:FB)\xa0reported fiscal 2014 second-quarter results last week\xa0and said its monthly active users rose to 1.32 billion as of June 30, up 14 percent year-over-year. The social network saw a 31 percent increase in mobile active users to 1.07 billion compared to the same period in 2013.“I think people have gotten over the notion that they [Twitter] need to have user growth and message growth,” Bliss said. “You saw that happen during the World Cup when they were setting records in some of those games. It’s clear that the platform has taken on a new life, not only here in the U.S., but globally for a variety of things.”Twitter is hosting a conference call with shareholders\xa0Tuesday, July 29 at 5 p.m. EDT to discuss the company’s second-quarter financial results.Tesla After the closing bell Thursday, Tesla Motors Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is expected to report fiscal 2014 second-quarter earnings of 4 cents a share, excluding items, on revenue of $810.57 million, analysts polled by Reuters predicted.The company posted earnings of 2 cents a share on sales of $551.95 million a year earlier. Meanwhile, the electric car maker reported net income of $17 million, or 12 cents per share, on revenue of $713 million for the first-quarter.“The real question with Tesla is how are they going to be able to grow out that infrastructure in a very quick way? They were supposed to announce plans to build a new battery plant, a $5 billion investment,” Bliss said. “There’s five states in the Southwest of the United States that are looking for that type of investment there. They need that to really substantiate the growth. By their estimates, they’re going to need to pump out about 500,000 new batteries every year.”Tesla announced plans in February to build a large scale $5 billion battery “Gigafactory” designed to reduce cell costs and, by 2020, produce more lithium ion batteries annually than were produced worldwide in 2013. The company said in May it has not yet finalized the ultimate location for the battery plant and is going to start work on at least two locations at the same time in order to minimize the risk of delays.“By the time the Gigafactory reaches full, annualized production in 2020, we expect battery pack production capacity to reach 50 GWh and cell production capacity to be 35 GWh,” Tesla said in the company’s first-quarter earnings report.Tesla posted a record first-quarter for Model S production with 7,535 vehicles and delivered 6,457 of them. For the second-quarter, the company expects to deliver 7,500 units of its Model S vehicle and estimates it will produce 8,500 to 9,000 cars in the second-quarter, a 13 percent to 19 percent increase over the previous quarter.The company said in May it is expanding its factory capacity to support increased Model S production later this year and plans to introduce the Model X next year. In addition, the automaker said extensive development on the Model X is underway and expects to have production design prototypes ready in the fourth-quarter.“We know that their earnings are going to be less from a year ago because they are investing in the business, but I want to see how much they’re investing in the business,” Bliss said. “How much of their Supercharger stations have they built? Can I drive from coast to coast through a variety of channels?”This year the company plans to increase the number of Supercharger locations by more than 75 percent from 2013. Tesla recently opened its 100th Supercharger station in New Jersey and plans to install 200 more Superchargers globally this year.“I think the market has gotten very comfortable with Elon Musk we trust,” Bliss added. \xa0\xa0Tesla is scheduled to host a conference call with shareholders at 5:30 p.m. EDT to discuss the company's second-quarter financial results and business outlook for the fiscal year.Shares of Tesla Motors are currently trading around $229.31 ahead of the company’s earnings announcement.\xa0""]"

His latest investment, Shift, started receiving its first shipment of Model S sedans from Tesla Motors, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) last week.In Nevada, car-sharing services like Uber have been unable to move in because of a state law requiring a $40 minimum hourly rate for livery services. Since Uber cars are “hailed” by users with a mobile app and not streetside hand-waiving, they are considered a livery, or limo service, as opposed to a traditional taxicab.Shift avoids the Nevada livery law by offering a “single monthly membership,” under which it promises – for a still undetermined price – to send users on their way “in five minutes or less.” Under the plan, Shift allows its members to drive its customized electric vehicles for a certain amount of hours, and picked up by drivers a specific number of times.""We are a car sharing company that also offers the added benefit of rides. We are not aiming to replace taxis,"" CEO Zack Ware said in an email to the International Business Times. ""Our fleet includes small Smart electric vehicles, Chevrolet Volts and Tesla Model S\'s. The vast majority of uses by our members will be the members driving themselves (similar to Zipcar).""\xa0Today we welcomed the first 5 Connectors to the #SHIFT team!

Shift also counts a number of Smart cars and Renault Twizys as members of its fleet, and currently has 30 employees, according to Quartz.Hsieh has invested $10 million in the service as part of his plan to revitalize downtown Las Vegas, and Ware is testing it on a limited basis. Shift is planning on offering a staggered rollout during the fall.While Uber and Lyft are busy giving taxi associations throughout metropolitan areas across the nation a run for their money, Shift incorporates elements of their business models, as well as the Zipcar approach to car rentals, and a bike-sharing feature for good measure.\xa0While tourists might balk at Shift’s monthly subscription, Las Vegas residents may find it more attractive, and it is they who Hsieh is trying to win over with the\xa0Downtown Project.An earlier version of this article incorrectly identified Tesla, as opposed to Shift, as having customized Model S sedans to be used without a key.

Orders from Europe and China are taking longer as the company juggles fulfilling U.S. orders while maintaining a steady stream of shipments to overseas markets, namely Northern Europe and China. \xa0Tesla Motors Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) spokesman Simon Sproule told Bloomberg that his company has halted production for two weeks to install more robotics and other equipment to speed up production of the Model S and to prepare for the release next spring of the Model X crossover SUV. The company’s current production pace is just under 800 cars a week.\xa0    Model S sales have increased 170 percent between the fourth quarter of 2012 and the first quarter of this year, nearly 6,500 cars. The company has said it would reach 7,500 deliveries in the second quarter ended June 30. The company will reveal the latest quarterly sales figures on July 31 after markets close in New York. Photo: IBTimes/Angelo Young  “It gets us ready to build X and to do it on the same line as the S,” Sproule told Bloomberg by phone. Financial details and the effect of the production stoppage will be addressed in more detail when Tesla releases its second-quarter financial results on July 31.Most of the company’s 370-acre Fremont facility is currently unused, and this marks the first significant expansion at the plant since the company bought it from New United Motor Manufacturing, Inc., a joint venture between Toyota Motor Corp. (TYO:7203) and General Motors Co. (NYSE:GM), for $42 million in 2010. In its prime during the '60s and '70s, the Fremont facility churned out over 1,000 Chevrolets, Pontiacs and Oldsmobiles a day for GM.But those days of blue-collar manual assembly of American gas guzzlers are gone. Tesla has turned a portion of the site into one of the more advanced manufacturing facilities. The company will be installing more so-called flexible robotics manufactured by Augsburg, Germany, plant engineering firm KUKA AG (ETR:KU2), which sells its multi-joint robotics arms to Daimler AG (ETR:DAI), Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (ETR:BMW) and other major auto manufacturers. Unlike the stamp-and-repeat robots of yore, modern flexible robotic assembly machines can perform different and increasingly intricate tasks.To demonstrate the capabilities of the more advanced robotic arms, KUKA released this video in March showing one of its robots defeating table tennis champion Timo Boll at his own game.""]"

Now, the California-made all-electric luxury sedan is reportedly being considered for the U.K. government’s $8.5 million program to introduce electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles into its agencies.By the fall, Whitehall says the government will begin purchasing its first wave of 150 plug-in vehicles for U.K. ministers.“The Model S we understand will be under evaluation for inclusion,” Tesla Motors Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) told Bloomberg. If the U.K. were to purchase Model S sedans it would be the first government to buy the high-end luxury electric car instead of more economical all-electric or hybrid plug-in vehicles.The Model S offers the longest range of any battery electric vehicle (BEV) in the market right now, but the car also cost significantly more than other BEVs or plug-in hybrids (PHEVs). And if U.K. ministers begin shuttling around in Model S sedans, they could be criticized for riding in imported foreign-made cars.The 2014 Nissan Leaf costs around $30,000 with a range of about 84 miles, according to the U.S. Department of Energy; that’s about half the price of a 60 kWh Model S with 208 miles of range. In January, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg was touting the government’s efforts to promote the use of electric cars through government incentives under the Go Ultra Low campaign. That $4.3 million program brings together the five biggest BEV and PHEV makers in the U.K.: Nissan Motor Co. Ltd. (TYO:7201), Renault SA (EPA:RNO), Toyota Motor Corp. (TYO:7203), Vauxhall Motors Ltd. and Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (ETR:BMW).Those automakers are likely to be strong contenders for the public procurement program, especially the Nissan Leaf, which is manufactured for the European market in Sunderland, U.K. Toyota also has manufacturing operations in the U.K.International Business Times reached out to the U.K. Department for Transport to see if there was any confirmation that Tesla was in the running for government procurement.“This announcement on Thursday did not set which models would be chosen for government fleets. It allows every agency to looks at which car suits their specific needs,” a press office spokesperson told International Business Times by phone on Monday. “The review considers the whole life-cost of each vehicle to determine the most cost-effective choice.”Telsa’s belief that it’s being evaluated by the U.K. government is likely a result to the image posted on the U.K. government’s website announcing the plan, which shows Minister of Transport Susan Kramer, Treasury Chief Secretary Danny Alexander and Cabinet Office Minister of State Oliver Letwin standing in front of five plug-in cars, including a Model S.In 2011, New York City began buying all-electric Nissan Leafs, Chevrolet Volts, Ford Transit Connects and Navi-star e-Star utility vans. Other U.S. state and local government have begun rolling out official plug-in vehicles. Range is less of an issue for many government fleet vehicles because they are more likely to have predictable routes where government charging stations can be installed and maintained. They are less likely to be used for long-distance driving, too, eliminating concerns over running out of power between charging stations.Tesla will announce its second-quarter financial statement on July 31.

(TSLA) Q2 2014 Earnings Preview: Tesla Seen Ekeing Out Slim Profit Amid Massive Expansion,Angelo Young,07/18/14,12:53 PM,"[""UPDATE July 31, 4:50 p.m. EST:\xa0Tesla second-quarter results are out. Tesla confirms that it broke ground on a battery factory site in Nevada, but said other locations are still being considered.\xa0Original story begins here:\xa0Tesla Motors Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is juggling a lot of expensive tasks right now, from growing its retail presence in China and Europe to preparing for the release next spring of its Model X full-sized electric crossover SUV.At the same time, Tesla is fleshing out its network of quick-charge stations in North America, Europe and China. And then there’s that $5 billion battery factory it’s planning to build in one of five states, each of which is quietly vying for the high-price investment. \xa0The public will get a chance to see Tesla’s progress in becoming the world’s only successful carmaker devoted exclusively to battery powered automobiles when the company announces its second-quarter financial results on July 31 after markets close in New York.\xa0“Certain costs should rise as the company expands internationally as it invests in technology and infrastructure,” Erfraim Levy, equity analyst for Standard & Poor’s, said in a research note. Risks, according to Levy, include slower-than-expected sales or delays in reducing costs.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect the Palo Alto, California, maker of the Model S luxury electric car to eke out a slim $3.4 million in profit, down from $26 million in the same quarter last year, as the company piles most of its estimated $810.6 million in revenue back into growing the business. Tesla is expected to lose 11 cents per share because of these investments.\xa0J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) auto analyst Ryan Brinkman said in a May research note that there would be a large jump in research and development expenses in the second quarter, “as the company continues to ramp up spending ahead of the Model X launch.”Not that anyone who believes in the Tesla cause is worried about the company's profitability right now.Over the past year Tesla’s stock price has climbed nearly 84 percent to just over $220 as investors throw money behind their convictions the company will sell hundreds of thousands of cars a year by the end of the decade. The company said earlier this year it expected to deliver 35,000 Model S sedans in 2014, and that its main hindrance right now is meeting demand for its cars with its current production capability.Sales will be one of the most important new developments in the upcoming earnings report. Unlike other automakers that report monthly, Tesla only reveals deliveries four times a year. In the first quarter the company sold 6,457 cars and produced 7,535. Nearly, 1,100 of these Model S sedans were sent to Europe and China to fulfill orders. The upcoming earnings report will offer the latest data on Tesla’s sales and production pace. The company has said it would deliver 7,500 vehicles in the second quarter. If sales fall under that number, it would raise questions about whether the company is losing momentum.Barclay’s analyst Brain Johnson said earlier this month that Tesla’s recent expansion into China would offset slow demand in Europe, where Tesla has been received coolly in Germany but reaps the benefits of favorable tax treatment for electric vehicles in Norway. Johnson sees Tesla meeting its sales estimate thanks to as many as 1,300 deliveries of the Model S in China.Another important factor to look for in the upcoming earnings report will be any progress on the so-called gigafactory that Tesla and its main lithium-ion cell supplier Panasonic Corp. (TYO:6752) have signed on to constructing somewhere in the Southwest or California. One of Tesla’s monumental challenges will be to secure a consistent supply of the lithium-ion cells that are packed inside each Model S battery. It’s this pricey component that gives the Model S that industry-leading electric-vehicle range of 265 miles.Without a consistent supply of these cells, Tesla can’t meet its long-term growth projections of a half-million annual deliveries by 2020. The gigafactory would give Tesla an annual supply of the 500,000 battery packs it would need by 2020.In May, CEO Elon Musk said in a conference call that ground would be broken on the first of the two gigafactory sites in June. But so far Tesla hasn’t announced the state in which the production sites would be located. Considering that the company’s financial statement is due out in less than two weeks, any announcement would likely appear on July 31.The company's gross profit margin, another important factor to look for in the earnings statement, is expected to have increase slightly, to 26 percent compared to just over 25 percent in the first quarter, an indication the company is trimming supply chain costs even as it spends heavily to build out its capacity to meet demand for the Model S.""]"

(NASDAQ:TSLA) recently gave us more information about its third-generation, lower- priced electric car aimed at a wider buyership. We now know it will be called the Tesla Model 3, it will be priced around $35,000, it will have the same range as the current Model S and it will be out by 2017, according to the Palo Alto electric car company.\xa0If the Model 3 were out today, it would destroy any of its competitors in the market. The recently introduced BMW i3, the closest thing to a luxury electric car for around $40,000, has less than half the range Tesla plans for the Model 3.“The pricing of Tesla\'s next sedan is an interesting component to have confirmed, but the real question is: How far will it go on a single charge?"" Karl Brauer, senior market analyst for automotive pricing and information provider Kelley Blue Book, said in an email. ""The current electric car market is flush with $35,000 cars, and they all have nearly identical range specs of 60-90 miles. If the Tesla Model 3 can\'t substantially increase that range, it will sell about as well as all the others -- which isn\'t very well.""The Nissan Leaf, the bestselling electric car in history, costs less than $30,000 but also suffers from range constraints, as do the Fiat 550e, the Chevy Spark EV, the Honda Fit EV and the other battery electric mini cars currently available in the marketplace.The Tesla Model S and the Model X due out next spring are the only two electric cars filling the niche in the luxury segment, which gives Tesla a big advantage among the small number of affluent purists willing to drop $70,000 or more for a car completely powered by lithium-ion batteries. Tesla’s current competition in the luxury electric car market is scarce and coming mostly from plug-in hybrids (PHEVs), like the Cadillac ELR and the Porsche Panamera S E-Hybrid. Tesla doesn’t consider PHEVs direct competition because they rely largely on internal combustion engines.As far as high-end electric cars are concerned, the playing field in expensive all-electrics is almost empty right now. Nissan Motor Co. Ltd. (TYO:7201) has announced it would produce the Infiniti LE with a range of 100 miles and a wireless charging system, but the project is currently on hold as the company focuses on tripling sales by 2017. Mercedes-Benz (FRA:DAI) offers an electric version of the SLS AMG, but it costs the same as five Model S sedans with considerably less range at 160 miles. The German automaker has also introduced an electric B-class hatchback with a 124-mile range aimed at the same consumer who would consider the i3 and the Model 3, but it wouldn’t excite car buyers enamored by the Model S.Three years is a long time by auto industry standards, and battery technology is changing fast enough that by the time the Model 3 is out, competing brands will have managed to improve their own battery technologies. Most industry analysts say a 100-mile range is the minimum for wider adoption of electric cars, and only Tesla and Mercedes have EVs that cross that boundary. That could change soon.Massachusetts Institute of Technology has been working on carbon nanotube electrodes that could greatly increase battery power, while in Colorado Prieto Battery Inc. is taking Colorado State University research and developing a new battery architecture using copper filaments to improve battery power and reduce charging time. Meanwhile, nearly every major automaker is engaged in some kind of research and development to improve battery technology to both lower the cost and extend the range of electric cars. The world’s top lithium-ion battery producers, Samsung SDI Co. Ltd. (KRX:006405), which supplies batteries to Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (FRA:BMW) and Chrysler LLC, and Panasonic Corp. (TYO:6752), which has a close relationship with Tesla, aren’t sitting idle, either.Telsa is betting that its proposed $5 billion so-called gigafactory will give it the manufacturing capacity to lower the cost of producing the battery packs. That’s how the company plans to offer the Model 3 at a price below $40,000. For the time being Tesla appears to be well ahead of the electric car race, but if electric cars are truly the future of automobiles, then the track will get a lot more crowded by the end of the decade.']"

(KRX:005380) vice president for U.S. product planning, told Green Car Reports a lot of the money invested in Tesla’s Supercharger network came from government “grants and loans.”Green Car senior editor John Voelker reached out to Diarmuid O\'Connell, Tesla Motors Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) vice president for business development, for a response.""I am furious at any allegation that any public money was spent on the Supercharger network,"" he told Voelker. ""Those sites have been paid for entirely by Tesla Motors -- which continues to spend money on expanding the network.""The Hyundai executive was referring to a Department of Energy program from which Tesla received a $465 million government loan\xa0in 2010 during an important phase in Tesla’s business development. At the time, Tesla was still a largely unknown private manufacturer of a two-seat electric “geek’s plaything” roadster. It would be six months before the company listed stock on the NASDAQ and two more years before the rollout of the critically acclaimed Model S luxury sedan.The government loan was a much needed injection of capital at the time, but it’s a stretch to suggest the money helped with the current ongoing development of Tesla’s Supercharger network, which in June reportedly delivered a record one gigawatt of electricity to U.S. Model S owners.Tesla will soon announce the date of its second quarter earnings release, expected early next month. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect the Palo Alto car company to squeeze out $3.4 million in profit on $810.6 million in revenue. Adjusted earnings per share are expected to be down 11 cents due to heavy global investment, a large part of which is building out the company’s quick-charge network in the United States, Europe and China.Like Toyota Motor Corp.

Hyundai recently began offering a hydrogen fuel cell version of its Tucson SUV under a lease program in Southern California, which has enough hydrogen fueling outlets to support consumer use.O\'Brien’s controversial remark was related to the need for more investment in hydrogen fueling infrastructure for the technology to become mainstream.

The Tesla hacking challenge that could see one enterprising geek walk away with $10,000 is aimed at underscoring one of the more vulnerable areas of car connectivity: the link between a driver’s mobile phone and the car’s onboard computer system.“Nowadays, advanced diagnostics enable cars to generate lots of profile data of engines and drivers, and submit them to the connected vehicle cloud,” according to the 2014 SyScan website. “Meanwhile, with the fast evolution of mobile technology, the number of mobile devices grows exponentially. When mobile connects both car and the vehicle cloud via mobile apps, the car becomes the new threat target.”Through the vehicle’s onboard Linux-based operating system, owners can check battery charge and lock and unlock the car using their mobile devices. The Model S also connects to the Internet through mobile phones. This week’s challenge will try to exploit any possible vulnerabilities between the mobile device and the car’s software.In November, Tesla Motors Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) disclosed just how much control of the vehicle can be taken when it released an “over-the-air update” that raised the Model S ground clearance at highway speed. The wireless adjustment was made by the Palo Alto, California, electric carmaker after two Model S sedans were involved in collisions with highway debris last year.Tesla is aware enough of the potential hacking issue that it hired computer security expert Kristin Paget from Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in February to bolster the security of the Model S and the upcoming Model X SUV due out next spring. \xa0“Can’t say too much but ‘securing things’ is a fair bet\xa0:),”\xa0Paget old the online webzine Re/code.In April, Tesla contacted a Model S owner who was snooping around the vehicle’s software by successfully connecting to the car’s internal Ethernet network using a cable and posting details of the connectivity to a Tesla fan forum.Three weeks later, he received a phone call from the car company informing him that his vehicle had been hacked. When he informed the company of what he had done, Tesla warned him that accessing the company’s onboard software could be considered industrial espionage, and, in any case, could void his warranty.']"

The gift was announced by cartoonist Matthew Inman, creator of webcomic The Oatmeal, on Thursday, the 158th anniversary of Tesla’s birth.Nikola Tesla, an inventor known for his contributions to the alternating current, or AC model of distributing electricity, is the namesake of Musk’s electric car company. The company’s Model S and Roadster incorporate a motor design based on a 1888 patent filed by the inventor.Inman requested that Musk donate money in May after posting a positive review of Tesla Motors’ Model S on Twitter.“Within a few hours of posting my review, Elon Musk tweeted that he'd be happy to help,” Inman wrote yesterday. “He's going to build a Tesla Supercharger station in the parking lot of the museum” and is “donating $1 million dollars to the museum itself.”Musk’s donation will go toward developing a museum, learning center and “innovation” center to help budding inventors, Inman said. The Tesla Science Center at Wardenclyffe is the site of Tesla’s last laboratory, where he worked at the turn of the 20th century to create a system of distributing wireless power. The 16-acre site was purchased last year with the proceeds from an Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign run by Inman.“We are excited and extremely grateful for Mr. Musk’s generous gift to Tesla Science Center, and also to Matthew Inman for arranging the opportunity,” Jane Alcorn, president of the Tesla Science Center, said in a press release.""]"

(NYSE:TM), according to TechCrunch. An additional nine stations are expected to be built with grant funding from California.Hydrogen has been touted as one of the renewable fuel alternatives to gasoline and diesel. But the lack of public hydrogen fuel stations has been a concern for car manufacturers.The opening of these additional stations will bring the total number of public stations to 37, which should stimulate the nascent fuel cell vehicle market. Some manufacturers, such as Toyota, already have vehicles in the works, ahead of the planned hydrogen fuel station openings.The Japanese automaker brought its production Fuel Cell Vehicle (FCV) to the 2014 Aspen Ideas Festival in June as an example of what’s to come with hydrogen fuel technology. According to Toyota, the four-door FCV will be able to travel 300 miles on a single tank of hydrogen fuel.While the current number of stations may be small in comparison to the nearly 10,000 gasoline stations in California, Toyota believes that strategic placement of hydrogen fuel stations could sufficiently serve the needs of fuel cell drivers without having to build as many stations.""If every vehicle in California ran on hydrogen, we could meet refueling logistics with only 15 percent of the nearly 10,000 gasoline stations currently operating in the state.” Bob Carter, senior VP of automotive operations, Toyota Motor Sales USA, said at CES 2014 in January.Other manufacturers such as Hyundai Motor Company (KRX:005380) and Honda Motor Co. Ltd. (NYSE:HMC) also have their own fuel cell vehicles lined up for release in 2015, which may bolster the growth of the fuel cell vehicle industry.In addition to competing with traditional gasoline and diesel vehicles, fuel cell vehicles also have to compete with fully electric vehicles. Tesla Motors Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) has provided similar “fueling” infrastructure throughout the East Coast and West Coast, where Tesla owners can quickly recharge their vehicle.But the competition may be beneficial overall for several states including California, which hope to put 3.3 million zero-emission vehicles on the road by 2025.']"

(NASDAQ: TSLA) are down after a fiery crash involving a stolen Model S raised safety concerns about the lithium-ion batteries used to power electric cars.Investors bid down Tesla shares by 2.9 percent to $222.66 on Monday, just days after\xa0a man stole an electric-powered sedan from a Tesla store in Los Angeles, led police on a high-speed chase and then slammed into several cars and a pole, the Wall Street Journal reported. Seven people were injured, but no deaths were reported in the July 4 accident that split the vehicle in half.The smashed sedan sprayed chunks of the car’s lithium-ion batteries around the street. Some of the pieces burst into flames and shot sparks through the air like fireworks, the WSJ noted, citing a broadcast report by television station KTLA-TV.The Los Angeles crash marks the fourth time a Tesla car has burned after a collision. The California-based carmaker’s stock dropped nearly 14 percent\xa0early last October\xa0after a Model S struck debris on a highway south of Seattle and caught fire.\xa0Two weeks later, shares took another hit after a Model S slammed into a concrete barrier and a tree in Mexico.Car fires are relatively common among gasoline-powered vehicles in the United States, but accidents involving electric vehicles garner extra attention because the battery packs are becoming powerful enough to raise concerns over lithium-ion chemical fire risks. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has criticized what he said is disproportionate media coverage of a handful of Model S fires. About 65,000 car fires occurred each year from 2008 to 2010, almost all of which involved conventional vehicles, according to a study by the U.S. Fire Administration.After the earlier crashes, Tesla added a titanium plate in March to increase protection of the lithium-ion batteries in the Model S vehicles. The luxury sedan has a five-star rating for crashworthiness, the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s highest designation.The company is working with Los Angeles police and fire officials to examine what exactly happened to the car during the July 4 crash, a Tesla spokesman told Bloomberg News.']"

(NASDAQ: AAPL)\xa0could buy Elon Musk’s electric-car superstar Tesla Motors Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) continue to float in Silicon Valley and throughout the Internet. But two other smaller partnerships between the tech firms might be more likely to see the light of day than an outright acquisition.That’s the take of Bilal Liaqat, a hedge fund analyst writing on the Seeking Alpha investment platform. He surmised that it is possible Tesla could consider incorporating iOS, Apple’s operating system, into touchscreen displays for the plug-in Model S vehicles. Musk, the carmaker’s founder and chief executive, has previously said that the Android operating system was rejected early on for Tesla cars because it wasn’t yet primed for use inside cars. “A Tesla iCar,” as Liaqat put it Wednesday, “would undoubtedly be the hottest vehicle to hit the market.”Excited murmuring around a possible Apple-Tesla connection first emerged last fall after Adnaan Ahmad, a Berenberg Bank analyst, issued an open letter to Apple’s top brass calling on the company to buy Tesla. And earlier this year, the San Francisco Chronicle revealed that Musk met quietly with Adrian Perica, Apple’s head of mergers and acquisition, in Cupertino, California, in early 2013.In a February interview with Bloomberg TV, Musk declined to divulge what that meeting was about. He confirmed that Tesla was in talks with Apple but wouldn’t comment on a possible partnership or merger with “one or more companies” that might have approached Tesla recently.While technophiles and deep-pocketed investors are left guessing, Liaqat has a second idea for a possible partnership: Tesla’s $5 billion “gigafactory.” Musk announced plans for the factory in February.If built, it would be able to produce enough battery packs to power 500,000 vehicles every year. Exact details -- like the factory’s location or a timetable for breaking ground -- haven’t yet been disclosed, but conceivably the plant could produce batteries to power other gadgets too -- namely, Apple’s, Liaqat said.“With Tesla’s gigafactory on the way, it is possible that … Apple -- and not Tesla -- could be on the gaining end,” he wrote.']"

The battery giant said it plans to invest hundreds of millions of dollars in the plant, which when completed will have the capacity to produce batteries for more than 100,000 electric cars per year, LG Chem said in a statement.The Korean company will operate the plant in partnership with two Chinese-controlled companies. LG Chem will own half of the joint venture, while the other half will be unevenly divided between the two Nanjing-based firms. LG Chem declined to disclose the total amount of investment by all three parties, Wall Street Journal reported.The Nanjing plant is expected to generate nearly $1 billion in total sales from 2015 to 2020, LG Chem said.The battery factory could give LG Chem an early edge in the burgeoning market for emission-free vehicles in China, according to analysts. While demand for electric cars has so far been sluggish in the world’s largest car market, Chinese sales are expected to pick up in the coming years thanks to government targets to put 500,000 plug-in cars on the road by 2015 and 5 million vehicles by 2020.“[LG Chem’s] expansion into China is positive in that it can gain early access to a potentially huge market, as demand for electric vehicles is expected to take off after 2015,” Lee Ji-Yeon, an analyst at Taurus Securities, told Financial Times.LG Chem’s plant will supply Chinese carmakers such as SAIC Motor (SHA: 600104)\xa0and Qoros Auto Co.

(TYO:7203), the world’s top carmaker, revealed more details about its much-anticipated fuel cell model, the FCV, including a teaser video and news that the car will launch in Japan next April. The Camry-sized sedan will be priced at 7 million yen ($68,687), the automaker said — about $1,000 less than the sticker price of a Model S.The pricing is unlikely to have been a coincidence, Lisa Jerram, a senior research analyst at Navigant Research, told Business Insider. “It does seem as though they’re attempting to compete in that category,” she said.Abe didn’t flesh out further details on his administration’s fuel cell subsidies. But he has outlined a goal of bringing fuel cell car prices down to $20,000 by 2025, which in turn should help meet his target of generating 1 trillion yen ($9.8 billion) for Japan through fuel cell sales by 2030.The news from Japan underscores the tensions in the zero-emission driving sector over which fledgling technology is likely to win out.Tesla CEO Elon Musk has derided fuel cell vehicles in the past, calling them “fool cells” and a ""bull****"" marketing gimmick. “Hydrogen is suitable for the upper stage of rockets, but not for cars,” he told a crowd of German Tesla fans in Munich last fall.With a fuel cell car, drivers pump compressed hydrogen into vehicle storage tanks, just as they would pump gas into a conventional car. The hydrogen interacts chemically with oxygen to produce electricity, which powers the engine. Unlike gasoline-powered cars, which spew pollution and greenhouse gases from their tailpipes, the fuel cell car’s only byproduct is water.Electric vehicles, by contrast, are powered by large battery packs, which are recharged by connecting to a charging station.About half the auto industry seems to be ditching electric vehicles in favor of fuel cell models, according to a note this week from Morgan Stanley. \xa0Analysts attributed the swap to waning consumer demand for electric models and the slow build-out of necessary battery-charging infrastructure, which is critical for extending driving range, Business Insider noted.']"

The first automaker to mass-produce a hybrid car, the Prius, insists that hydrogen fuel cell technology is the future of zero-emission driving. The world’s top automaker revealed Wednesday more details about the FCV, the hydrogen-powered car that has been making the rounds at global auto shows over the past two years.The sedan, about the size of a Camry, will go on sale in Japan next April for 7 million yen ($68,687). Toyota released a teaser video of the car on Tuesday ahead of a company press briefing at its Japanese headquarters. The video doesn’t show much, but it’s the first time the FCV is shown being driven on city streets, at least in computer-rendered form.Toyota has been investing in fuel cell infrastructure in California, which has also committed nearly $50 million to build stations that pump compressed hydrogen into vehicle storage tanks. Last year it announced a $7.2 million investment in a startup to build out fuel cell stations in the state. The hydrogen interacts chemically with oxygen to produce electric power whose byproduct is water.Telsa’s Musk says the systems are good for space transport -- he uses the technology in SpaceX, his own space cargo transport company -- but are impractical for mass-produced passenger cars.Toyota and other automakers that have been working on the technology disagree.

(NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk announced his company would make its electric-vehicle patents public in an attempt to promote the technology that lowers carbon emissions, top electric carmakers are reportedly coming together to figure out how to standardize electric car technology.Like consumer electronics, the electric cars in the marketplace have different power needs and plugs, which means a Nissan Leaf can’t link to a Tesla charging station and a Tesla Model S requires a $1,000 adapter to plug in to public charging stations.Electric cars have different power standards, and countries vary in their adoption of charging configurations, such as CHAdeMo and CCS. This is viewed as an impediment to wider adoption of the technology. After all, all gasoline-burning passenger cars can be easily refueled at any gas station, while electric car owners are not as readily served.“It is obviously clear that everyone would benefit if there was a far more simple way for everyone to charge their cars,” an executive who declined to be named because the plans are not yet worked out told the Financial Times.Tesla and its main rivals in the market for green machines, German luxury carmaker Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (FRA:BMW), which recently released its i3 five-door urban electric car, and leading electric carmaker Nissan Motors Co. Ltd. (TYO:7201), are deciding how to cooperate in the expansion of charging networks.Nissan’s involvement is important because it makes the world’s most popular electric vehicle, the Leaf. Tesla’s involvement is important because the Model S is the first electric car to carry a large battery pack that produces well over 100 kilowatts of power, more than twice the punch (and range) of smaller city EVs, like the Leaf and the i3.Tesla, BMW and Nissan together account for about 80 percent of the tiny global EV market, mainly due to the popularity of the Leaf. In January, Nissan sold its 100,000th Leaf, doubling sales of the EV over the previous 12 months. Sales of the Tesla Model S broke 25,000 in January, and the company says it could deliver more but is facing supply constraints that aren’t keeping up with demand of the luxury EV, whose starting price is about $70,000.Nissan and Tesla met last week to discuss the issue, but both denied it was related to Musk’s announcement that he would not file Tesla patent lawsuits “against anyone who, in good faith, wants to use our technology.”']"

(NASDAQ:TSLA), said Thursday he is unleashing the company’s patents to the public in an attempt to spur more competition. In the lobby of Tesla’s Palo Alto, California, headquarters, where rows of framed patents once formed neat, glassy grids, the walls are now bare.In the ""spirit of the open source movement ... Tesla will not initiate patent lawsuits against anyone who, in good faith, wants to use our technology,” Musk announced on Tesla’s website.The company, he said, was created to accelerate the use of sustainable transportation. “If we clear a path to the creation of compelling electric vehicles, but then lay intellectual property landmines behind us to inhibit others, we are acting in a manner contrary to that goal.”Tesla has long been the darling of the fledgling electric car sector. Last year, it announced its first-ever quarterly profit just as its competitors were filing for bankruptcy. And Consumer Reporters called the Tesla Model S sedan the best car the magazine has ever tested.But with a $70,000 price tag (excluding federal and state tax incentives), the Model S is largely out of reach for the driving masses. Even the Chevy Volt and Nissan Leaf, which cost about half as much, have proven too pricey for many U.S. drivers.Electric cars account for fewer than 1 percent of all vehicles sold in the United States, with fewer than 220,000 plug-in cars on the road today, according to the Electric Drive Transportation Association. That’s a far cry from the Obama administration’s goal of having 1 million electric vehicles on U.S. roads by 2015. America is unlikely to hit that milestone before 2025, according to forecasts reported by The Hill.Opening up Tesla’s patents could help drive down costs and alleviate sticker shock. It could also help to squelch consumers\' “range anxiety” — the fear of running out of juice mid-road trip and having nowhere to charge the car\'s battery. Tesla is busy expanding a network of “Supercharger stations” across the U.S., which the company said could be available for drivers of non-Tesla electric cars, as well. Tesla executives met with the German carmaker BMW (FWB:BMW) this week in a move that Reuters reported could lead to the creation of multi-vehicle charging stations.“We believe that Tesla, other companies making electric cars, and the world would all benefit from a common, rapidly evolving technology program,” Musk said in his patent announcement. “Our true competition is not the small trickle of non-Tesla electric cars being produced, but rather the enormous flood of gasoline cars pouring out of the world’s factories every day.”Allowing other car companies to use its patents, which are already public, doesn’t mean that Tesla will also unlock its trade secrets and processes, David Cole, an analyst who heads AutoHarvest Foundation, told the Los Angeles Times.""Tesla is sure to have figured out some things along the way that they have not patented,"" Cole said.

(NASDAQ:TSLA) said this week in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing that it’s having difficulty determining the source for some of the raw materials used in building its all-electric cars due to the complexity and scope of the global supply chain. The statement highlights a downside to well-meaning legislation designed to assure that American firms make efforts to avoid commodities whose sale funds African warlords.Companies like Tesla and Hewlett-Packard Co. (NASDAQ:HPQ) are required to disclose their efforts to identify sourcing of so-called conflict minerals from the Democratic Republic of Congo and its neighbors under a section of the Dodd-Frank legislation passed several years ago. The particular section of the law was designed to increase supply chain transparency and give shareholders and consumers information to encourage companies to procure materials more ethically.“Tesla has not yet been able to fully identify countries of origin of the necessary conflict minerals and smelters and refiners used to process the necessary conflict minerals in Tesla’s products,” the company said in its regulatory filing on Monday, referring to four minerals used heavily in the manufacture of electronics and lithium-ion batteries (gold, tin, tungsten and tantalum) that have been linked to human rights abuses in war-torn Central Africa. Tesla says one of the biggest challenges is that its suppliers “are not directly subject to the same conflict minerals law and regulations as we are.”The Democratic Republic of Congo, Africa’s second-largest country by area, sits on trillions of dollars of untapped natural resources, especially precious and industrial metals. But given decades of internal strife, today various warlords control much of the country’s eastern portion and they operate small mines where workers as young as 12 labor in dangerous and coercive conditions.Making things more difficult, these minerals are often smuggled out of the country to smelters and refiners. That leaves no records and makes tracing their origins more difficult.“The artisanal miners are just trying to survive. They probably don't care too much about these [disclosure] rules. It would be more concerning to the various mining companies, militias and middlemen,” New York City-based photographer Mark Craemer, who travelled to D.R. Congo in 2011 to document the miners’ daily lives, said by email.According to the SEC, companies must “exercise due diligence on the . . . source and chain of custody” of the ore from which gold, tin, tungsten and tantalum are extracted. Tesla is just one of the manufacturers that has yet to be able to provide a comprehensive list of suppliers that use these minerals.“On one hand, committing to using only conflict-free materials can involve paying higher costs for those materials,” said a report last year in the Journal of Accountancy regarding the new disclosure rule. “On the other hand, a company risks falling behind with respect to reputation and goodwill if its products include conflict minerals from the affected areas while its competitors commit to a conflict-free business plan.”The scope of the task is huge because so many manufactured goods include the metals. Tin is used in stuff as varied as product packaging, zippers and an ingredient to stabilize perfume. Tantalum can be found in ballpoint pens and watches.But the most common use of these minerals is in the manufacture of electronic components, like capacitors found in computers and mobile devices, and in lithium-ion batteries like the ones Tesla uses in its Model S electric car.“The big tech companies have been with us from the beginning, have had more time to identify their sources and have more complete lists,” said Julie Schindall, director of communications for the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition, which since 2008 has been involved with the Conflict-Free Sourcing Initiative. The CFSI has been urging companies to use its reporting template\xa0to standardize the data.“What companies realized six years ago when we started was that they couldn’t tell much about the source of materials beyond their first- or second-tier suppliers,” she added. “Some of these supply chains can have eight or nine tiers, so it can be very difficult to track.”Since Monday, hundreds of companies have filed conflict mineral reports, some with more detail than others.Hewlett-Packard has been trying to identify its mineral sources for several years. But still, out of the listed 200 suppliers in its conflict minerals report filed last week,\xa0more than half were still listed as “unknown.”Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) issued a similar report list last week noting that \xa0205 different smelters and refiners supply materials that end up in its products.Maisam Abbasi, an industrial engineer at Sweden’s Lund University who specializes in sustainable supply chain logistics, said bringing together producers and suppliers across a global, multi-tier supply chain is a good first step toward sustainability and ethical sourcing practices.“Based on the academic literature, co-development has proven to be more effective than imposing restrictions on companies,” Abbasi said by telephone. “It’s important to encourage them to collaborate with suppliers, and if this step doesn’t’ work, then you can go to tougher measures, such as sanctions.”Abbasi said third-party auditors can help address what he calls “cascading responsibility,” where every link in a supply chain would be required to disclose to the other the sources of its raw materials and other details affecting the lives of the workers at the lowest rung of the supply ladder.""]"

Currently the U.S. uses the\xa0RD-180\xa0engine made by NPO Energomash, which is largely owned by the Russian government and whose chief, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin, is now subject to U.S. sanctions.That further complicates the U.S. government’s position in a lawsuit SpaceX filed claiming the right to bid on U.S. contracts currently locked up by the Russian firm.But now events may overtake the lawsuit.Earlier this week on Twitter, Rogozin warned, “Russia is ready to continue deliveries of RD-180 engines to the U.S. only under the guarantee that they won’t be used in the interests of the Pentagon.” \xa0Given the fact that the Defense Department’s secret satellite launch program incorporates the engines, it’s not hard to see the implications of Rogozin’s words.On Thursday, a top Pentagon official told Bloomberg that despite the SpaceX lawsuit and reports to the contrary, the U.S. wants to use Musk’s engines.“We’ve got folks busting their butt to get SpaceX certified despite what everything in the media seems to say,” Lt.

https://www.ibtimes.com/tesla-first-quarter-earnings-five-things-look-1580893,Tesla First Quarter Earnings: Five Things To Look For,Angelo Young,05/06/14,6:04 PM,"[""Tesla Motors Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) has emerged as the first luxury-level electric sedan maker with the potential to move beyond boutique-automaker and become the world’s only mass-producer of exclusively all-electric vehicles. After markets close in New York on Wednesday, the world will see how much closer the Fremont, California, company has gotten toward that goal.The maker of the Model S luxury electric car is expected to report higher revenue and gross margins, but lower net income, as the company has expanded its global reach over the past year. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters forecast that Tesla has attracted $699 million in revenue, up 24 percent from the same quarter last year, and netted $13 million in profit, or 10 cents per share. Adjusted for one-time costs, the EPS is expected to be a loss of 18 cents.Tesla’s stock has been driven up nearly 208 percent over the past year thanks to investors’ appetite for the company’s future potential. Though the automaker has only delivered one positive-growth quarter (based on fully reported earnings per share), the stock has leaped from just over $55 a year ago to a 52-week high of $265 in early March. Since then, there’s been a much-needed correction with the stock settling on Tuesday at $207.15. Wednesday’s report will give an indication of where the stock is headed into the summer.Here are five important things to look out for in Wednesday’s earnings report.1) Where will the gigafactory be built and who will help Tesla pay for it? The company said it’s planning to build a 10-million-square foot factory at a cost of up to $5 billion to produce enough lithium-ion cells to support production of 500,000 electric cars a year. Tesla sold $2 billion in convertible bonds in February that were quickly snatched up mostly by institutional investors. The automaker needs partners, and a location. Panasonic Corp. (TYO:6752), which currently makes and supplies the cells for the Model S, and Daimler AG (ETR:DAI), which owns a small stake in Tesla and uses the company’s electric drive, have publicly expressed hesitancy about becoming partners in the deal. Any guidance on when (of not how or where) the company expects to move forward on the project would be significant.2) In mainland China, Tesla opened its retail operations, delivered its first Model S car and opened its first Supercharger quick-charge station. To underscore China’s importance to Telsa’s global strategy, CEO Elon Musk handed the key to the first mainlander to buy one of his cars. The Chinese government wants 5 million electric cars on its roads by 2020 in order to reduce smog and dependence on foreign oil. Tesla might outline its progress in fleshing out its charger network and plans to open a manufacturing facility in the world’s biggest single market for luxury cars. Plans to manufacture the Model S (and future Telsa cars) in China would not only bring the $122,000 Model S starting price down but also might encourage China to extend any incentives it offers to domestic electric car manufacturers to the California carmaker. Tesla’s current largest market outside of the U.S. is Norway, whose generous green-vehicle incentives have helped Tesla. Reproducing a similar advantage in China would be good news.3) How is the company progressing in manufacturing and sales growth? The company has said it plans to deliver 35,000 units this year, up from 22,500 in 2013, the first year the 10-year-old company has expanded globally. It currently produces 600 cars a week from its Fremont plant. Look for any increase in this number. The company says it would be making 1,000 cars a week by the end of the year. The company will likely provide more details about the upcoming Model X crossover, which is supposed to begin production in early 2015. If Tesla follows a typical product cycle of an auto manufacturer, it will be due for fresh product by then. Any delays in Model X production would be a red flag. The lower-cost Gen III is due out by 2017. The $35,000 to $40,000 smaller Tesla should expand the company’s consumer base, but few details have been provided, especially regarding the vehicle’s range compared to the Model S. A cheaper Tesla would expand the company’s consumer base at the cost of profit margin. But a $40,000 electric vehicle with a range of at least 100 miles would be better than any current lower-cost EV on the market. The sooner a Tesla like that comes out, the better for the company, because competing automakers are also aiming for a Gen III-type vehicle.4) Gross margin must stay above 25 percent and preferably higher than the 24.9 percent announced in the fourth quarter. In the first quarter of last year, the gross margin was 17.4 percent. Tesla says it can get to 28 percent by the end of the year. Achieving that will be harder if the company reports flat or lower gross margins compared to the fourth quarter.5) Cost of expansion. Look for capital and administrative costs increases. Look for guidance on when the company expects these costs to decline. There are currently 76 Superchargers in North America, which allows Tesla car owners to charge their cars for free, but there's still a long way to go and a lot to spend to get the full U.S. coverage. The company could provide details on its previously announced quick-swap option, where for a fee Model S owners will be able to quickly swap batteries at some Supercharger stations. Any further information on expansion costs and how they might impact future earnings and margins will be important.""]"

(NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk said on Monday that the company will begin manufacturing its electric vehicles in China within the next three to four years, and it will build a network of charging stations that will be\xa0independent from China's main power grid, which is run by the State Grid Corporation of China (SGCC).“At some point in the next three or four years, we’ll be establishing local manufacturing in China,” Musk said. “China is very important to the future of Tesla. We’re going to make a big investment in China in terms of charging infrastructure.”Musk introduced the Model S electric vehicle at the Geekpark Conference in Beijing on Monday, and he told reporters on Tuesday that the Palo Alto, Calif.-based company is planning to invest hundreds of millions of dollars in projects located in the country, Bloomberg reported.Manufacturing cars in China, the world's second largest economy, will allow Tesla to avoid the country's 25 percent import tariff and offer its vehicles at lower prices. The Model S will start at 734,000 yuan ($118,000) in China, compared with $71,000 in the U.S.Higher prices may be just one of several hurdles Tesla will have to clear to achieve its sales goals in China. Chinese consumer adoption of electric vehicles\xa0has been slow in the country so far, as much of the country lacks the infrastructure needed to support them, according to CNN. In its ongoing battle against air pollution, the Chinese government offers subsidies to electric car owners, but that program has not achieved great success thus far.The company’s plan to build a charging station network might help electric vehicle adoption, but some experts are skeptical.“Tesla CEO in China, says will build a charging station network independent from State Grid,” Bill Bishop, a China expert and the curator of the popular Sinocism China Newsletter, said on Twitter. “I needed a good laugh this evening.”\xa0""]"

(NYSE:LMT) and Boeing Co. (NYSE:BA) joint venture uses Russian-built engines on Atlas V rockets, which launch U.S. military satellites into space. But now the relationship between the joint venture and Russia has come under close scrutiny after the U.S. and Europe announced sanctions against Russia for its actions in Crimea.The review, reported on Thursday by Bloomberg News, comes after U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said last week at a House of Representatives meeting that there was going to be a thorough reassessment of U.S-Russia relations.The U.S. currently contracts launches out to the joint venture group, called the United Launch Alliance, which uses the Russian made RD-180 rocket engine.The government's concern is that it might be put in a position where it has to rely on equipment from a potential future enemy. The same concerns were raised when it was discovered that some parts of the Air Force's F-16 jet fighter were discovered to made in China. The Pentagon had to ask for a waiver for the company that made those particular parts because of their top-secret nature and foreign origin.The current situation with Russia is different because the U.S. isn’t only concerned about national security -- the U.S. wants to place strict sanctions on Russia, and that includes ripping up existing contracts among businesses that work with Russia and Russian companies. However, Pentagon officials estimated that it would cost $1 billion and take up to five years to build the engines domestically, said Maureen Schumann, a Pentagon Spokesperson, via an email that appeared in a Bloomberg report.Waiting in the wings is Elon Musk, co-founder of Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) and CEO of Space X, who said at a March 5 congressional hearing that the Atlas V rockets should be phased out in the interest of national security.However, it’s also been well documented that Musk’s Space X program has its own rockets and delivery system, and it relies only on U.S. made engines.

https://www.ibtimes.com/arizona-one-four-states-vying-tesla-gigafactory-crafting-legislation-tailored-fit-1562599,"Arizona, One Of Four States Vying For That Tesla Gigafactory, Is Crafting Legislation Tailored To Fit Tesla's Retail Goals",Angelo Young,03/20/14,10:37 AM,"[""A week after New Jersey joined four other states in blocking efforts by Tesla Motors Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) to establish its own dealerships, an Arizona state senate committee approved a bill specifically crafted to welcome Tesla’s retail aspirations while excluding all other auto manufacturers.Here are the conditions a manufacturer must meet to sell directly to buyers in brick-and-mortar dealerships under\xa0HB 2123:“Authorizes a factory to sell, lease or provide, or offer to sell, lease or provide, a vehicle or product, service or financing to any retail consumer if the factory: a) only manufactures electric vehicles; and b) has a service center in Arizona to handle repair, warranty or recall issues regarding the vehicles.”The bill is clearly handcrafted for Tesla since it’s the only currently viable automaker that only produces electric vehicles for the mass market. This same advantage helped the company rake in tens of millions of dollars last year under California’s zero-emission vehicle program by selling its allotment of ZEV credits to makers of cars that burn gasoline.\xa0If the bill passes, Arizona would switch sides in the Tesla sales ban that pits the nation’s auto dealership system, whose advocates claim manufacturers aren't as capable retailers as independent businesses, against Tesla supporters who argue that restrictions barring Tesla from controlling its own retail operations are anathema to free market capitalism.In states where the ban against manufactures’ direct sales are in place, Tesla is only allowed to operate “galleries,” where the company's representatives are barred from discussing the vehicles’ pricing options [could this be a First Amendment issue?] or offer any other help in making purchasing decisions. Customers are barred from test driving the vehicles, too. If you want a Model S in these states, you have to order it online and have it delivered, complicating the purchasing process.Tesla has won battles against the ban in Massachusetts, where in January the automaker won a lawsuit against dealers there, and Minnesota and North Carolina, where bills to bar manufacturers from direct sales failed to pass the statehouses. Currently, Virginia, Maryland, Arizona, New Jersey and Texas have instituted a ban and dealers are pushing for similar prohibitions in Ohio and New York.Tesla CEO Elon Musk told Automotive News last year he would rather duke this out in federal court rather than fight little battles in the states. And, last week, Musk lambasted New Jersey lawmakers for bowing to dealership-network interests, and he suggested dealers fear electric cars will harm their profits because they don’t require as much servicing as internal-combustion engine vehicles.The Arizona Senate committee vote may have ulterior motives, as this map Tesla posted in late February suggests:    Four states -- Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas -- are vying for Tesla's planned massive lithium-ion factory.  Photo: Tesla Motors presentation  Arizona is one of four states vying for Tesla’s planned “gigafactory,” which will produce lithium-ion batteries it currently buys from Osaka-based Panasonic Corp. (TYO:6752). The company's sole product, the Model S sedan, uses about 7,000 Li-ion 18650 batteries, which resemble standard AA batteries. Last month, the company floated $2 billion in convertible bonds to raise capital to fund the factory, which Tesla would like to have online by 2020 for an estimated total cost of between $4 billion and $5 billion.\xa0Texas, where Musk is considering a commercial orbit launch site for his space transport services company Space Exploration Technologies Corporation (SpaceX), could also be changing its tune. State Rep. Jason Villalba (R-Dallas) wrote a letter to Musk dated March 3 selling his state as a “fertile and productive ecosystem” for Tesla to build its battery factory.Similar to Arizona, Texas has a bill (HB 3351) that would allow makers of “only all electric-powered or all battery-powered motor vehicles” to set up retail operations in the state. With Texas trying to woo Musk for a massive factory and a space-launch vehicle, the bill’s chances of getting passed might have increased since its introduction a year ago.""]"

This could be tricky for the U.S. as it’s illegal for the U.S. or government-affiliated companies to use parts from potential future enemies of the country. It was the same law that caused outrage over the F-16 jet fighter, which had been assembled using parts from China. Russia could fall into the same category, given the events unfolding in Crimea.\xa0With the uncertainty about the project under new sanctions, Elon Musk, the co-founder of Tesla Motors Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) and owner of Space Exploration Technologies Corp., known as SpaceX, waded into the issue in front of Congress and explained that his rockets are made in the U.S. and would not be impacted by any sanctions.“It’s just kind of embarrassing that the United States has to thumb rides from the Russians,” said Elon Musk in a Bloomberg television interview.Musk told the Senate subcommittee that Boeing and Lockheed’s joint venture, United Launch Alliance LLC might be at risk under any sanctions the U.S. bring against Russia.President Obama announced Monday that about 11 Russian and Ukrainian nationals would have their assets frozen, and he warned of further measures if Russia did not leave Crimea.Musk’s appearance in front of the committee had little to do with compassion for Boeing and Lockheed’s potential Russian headache, but rather seemed like a way for him to muscle in on the $70 billion launch program created after the U.S. retired its shuttle fleet in 2011. He said the U.S. should phase out the current option, an Atlas V Rocket, which uses Russian engines, for “long-term security of the country.”SpaceX has already made some inroads into the market. It was the first private company to dock at the space station and it now makes regular cargo deliveries under a $1.6 billion contract with NASA. Among its next goals: to develop a craft that transports astronauts and get some of the $70 billion government funds so it can launch satellites into space.It’s unlikely that the tension between the U.S. and Russia will affect the international space station given that the U.S. and Russia rely on each other to keep the operation running. In addition, the U.S. will pay Russia significant sums to Roscosmos, the Russian equivalent to NASA, to ferry astronauts to the space station in 2016. An email from a NASA spokesperson said that the two agencies have maintained a good relationship throughout the ups and downs of U.S.-Russian relations.However, in the same email, the spokesperson said that NASA would look to award contracts to U.S. companies, helping end the reliance on Russia for getting to space, but that won’t end the reliance on Russian engines, which could still be used to launch satellites.Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel has already said that the U.S. will look into replacing the Atlas V rockets in light of Russia’s actions in Crimea. However, that could take a while. Michael Gass, the CEO of the joint venture, told the senators that the U.S. had fallen behind in technological terms and a delegation from the joint venture that visited Russia said the Russian engineers and scientists were doing things that “our textbooks said was impossible.”But the clock is ticking. Gass said they have around two years’ worth of engines left and blueprints to build more; however, it might not be viable to build the engines fast enough to meet the current demand.\xa0']"

Neal,02/25/14,3:05 PM,"['Shares of Tesla Motors Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) continued to soar on Tuesday following the announcement of a new “Giga Factory,” a $46 million fourth-quarter profit, and a Morgan Stanley report that claimed that the Palo Alto, Calif.-based automaker could be on the verge of disrupting two global industries. \xa0The report, titled “Nikola’s Revenge: TSLA’s New Path of Disruption,” was released by Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jones on Tuesday. Jones doubled Morgan Stanley’s price target for Tesla stock from $153 per share to $320.As of this writing, shares of Tesla stock have increased more than 32 points since Jones released the note, a 15 percent increase.In its impressive fourth-quarter earnings statement, Tesla reported that it is responding to increased demand with new production capabilities. Tesla is expected to reveal specific plans for the so-called Giga Factory, a new way to mass-produce the batteries that power Tesla cars, later this week. The Giga Factory is predicted to reduce the cost of the battery cells so much that it could impact the entire electrical grid storage industry.“Tesla’s request to disrupt a trillion $ [sic] car industry offers an adjacent opportunity to disrupt a trillion $ electric utility industry,” Jones said in the report. Jones predicted that Tesla will produce 370,000 vehicles by 2020 and that its battery cells can be used by the utility industry for backup storage on electrical grids. \xa0Some say that these batteries could be the missing piece in completing a renewable energy grid. Morgan Stanley said Tesla’s Giga Factory could impact the way all sorts of batteries are produced, and used Tesla’s partnership with SolarCity as evidence that the company is interested in the energy industry.Jones also predicted that Tesla is uniquely positioned to dominate the future industry of autonomous cars.“Tesla’s fleet is 100-percent electric and connected,” Jones said in the report. “As the role of software engulfs the car, the world’s only Silicon Valley-based car company has the upper hand.”\xa0']"

(NASDAQ:TSLA) to the mainland.In an interview with Chinese-language Shanghai Securiites News published Wednesday, BYD Auto CEO Wang Chuanfu was paraphrased as saying the Tesla Model S a “rich man’s toy” that will be bought by a sliver of the population that can afford an electric car in Tesla’s price range.Wang brushed aside concerns over the Model S taking market as BYD rolls out the Qin, a plug-in-hybrid, a car like the Chevrolet Volt manufactured by General Motors Co. (NYSE:GM) that can run for short distances on electric-only. The Qin can travel 41 miles on battery power alone, a segment leader in plug-in hybrid range if that estimate is accurate. It began selling in Shenzhen in December for about $31,200 and will go to BYD dealership in Shanghai in March. \xa0“Currently, the demand for the Qin exceeds our supply,” Wang was quoted as saying by the South China Morning Post. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has said the same thing about his all-electric Model S, which went on sale on the mainland last month.The base price of the Model S sedan is high in China, at about $121,300. Tesla was quick to point out when announcing the price last month that the price is thanks to Chinese import duties, the Chinese value-added tax and the cost of delivering the vehicle.BYD Auto, whose parent BYD Company is partially owned by American business magnate Warren Buffet, wants to become the premiere electric vehicle maker in the country, and CEO Wang Chuanfu thinks now is the time to get the wheels rolling as the government hopes to promote EV use in the larger, smog-choked cities. The plan right now is 500,000 all-electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles on the streets by the end of next year though incentives to car buyers in 28 cities.In 2011, BYD abandoned plans to introduce its e6 all-electric car to the U.S. market and instead focused on opening a electric bus factory in Lancaster, California, under the name BYD Coach & Bus.Tesla CEO Elon Musk has said all along that his long range plan to make electric cars mainstream would start with vehicles in the luxury segment and then work down to lower-cost electric cars in the mass market.In any case, BYD only makes one all-electric passenger car, the e6, whose sales have been dismal as Chinese consumers are still highly skeptical of eschewing gasoline engines altogether. A deal signed in 2012 between BYD and Britain’s Green Tomato Cars to put 50 e6 taxis on London’s streets fell apart last week when the two sides mutually agreed to scuttle the agreement without explanation. One of the biggest challenges to electrifying taxi fleets there or in most big cities is the lack of charging infrastructure. The London Telegraph reported on Monday that 20 of the vehicles had already been delivered and would be operated by a recent startup called Thriev, which currently features a Nissan Leaf on its home page.Considering the lackluster embrace of all-electric vehicles in China right now it might not just be the Model S that could be called a toy.\xa0']"

The company’s shares have surged more than five times over the past 12 months, Bloomberg reported.\xa0With Tuesday\'s closing stock price, the market valuation of the Model S sedan company stands at $25 billion, which is worth about $1.1 million for each of the 22,450 Model S cars it sold in 2013. The cars sell for $70,000 to $100,000 apiece, depending on options.Investors reacted positively after a recent report by the San Francisco Chronicle said that Elon Musk, Tesla’s CEO and co-founder, met with Adrian Perica, Apple\'s head of mergers and acquisitions, last spring to discuss a potential buyout.Musk said, in an interview with Bloomberg last year, that an acquisition could be “one of the possible outcomes” for the company, and that a potential buyer would have to have enough cash. Although Musk did not name any particular company at the time, he acknowledged Apple’s position as a cash-rich company. Apple reportedly has approximately $160 billion in cash.However, analysts are less optimistic about an acquisition anytime soon.“There is a lot of pressure on Apple right now to find new markets to grow in. But Apple taking a bite of Tesla seems unlikely,” Craig Irwin, an analyst with Wedbush Securities, was quoted by Australian Financial Review as saying. “I see this as highly improbable. But it is one of the things that drives enthusiasm for the stock.”According to Thilo Koslowski, an analyst with Gartner (NYSE:IT), Tesla\'s stock would have gained more than 3 percent if there was any real evidence of a merger with Apple. According to Koslowski, a collaboration between the two companies is a more realistic event than a takeover.Tesla is scheduled to release its fourth-quarter earnings Wednesday, with investors having an “expectation of positives on the upcoming conference call,” according to Irwin.How Will Apple\'s Takeover Of Tesla Help?According to some market observers, Apple could be interested in Tesla’s battery technology, which could mean the Cupertino-based tech giant could more efficient mobile devices.Tesla\'s vehicles are powered by the same lithium-ion battery technology that is used in Apple\'s portable devices, and the electric-car company has made great advances in developing more efficient batteries, AppleInsider reported.In addition to better battery technology, an Apple-Tesla merger could also lead to tighter ""iOS in the car"" integration with Tesla’s vehicles.While Apple has not commented on the merger rumor, Tesla is expected to say more about Musk’s meeting with Perica. Tesla also is reportedly planning to build a massive battery manufacturing plant in partnership with other companies, and the announcement is expected to come sometime this month.']"
https://www.ibtimes.com/tesla-motors-inc-tsla-fourth-quarter-2013-earnings-five-things-look-when-model-s-1556202,Tesla Motors Inc. (TSLA) Fourth Quarter 2013 Earnings: Five Things To Look For When The Model S Maker Announces Results On Feb. 19,Angelo Young,02/18/14,6:51 AM,"['UPDATE, Feb. 18, 9 a.m. -- An analyst at Robert W. Baird & Co., the Madison, Wis.-based global financial services firm, released a bullish report on Tesla this morning.\xa0""We believe several catalysts could drive\xa0the stock higher including 2014 delivery guidance, additional battery factory details,\xa0and a possibility for more info on a new production line,"" Baird analyst Ben Kallo wrote in a research note released Tuesday.Kallo sees earnings per share coming in at 21 cents and estimates sales as high as 32,000 units in 2014. ""Based on our channel checks,"" he added, ""we believe TSLA is in a site selection process to determine which state will provide the highest tax benefits and subsidies for a battery factory.""\xa0Original story begins here: \xa0As with many exciting startups, market watchers and investors aren’t looking for the same guidance in Tesla Motors Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) earnings reports that they would seek in those of a seasoned, dividends-paying blue chip stock.\xa0Profitability concerns will take a back seat to more important considerations right now for the automaker, namely progress on margin and revenue growth, sales and production volume, improvements in fixing vehicle-supply constraints and any updates on the highly anticipated Model X crossover. \xa0Tesla will release its fourth quarter and full-year 2013 earnings on Wednesday after markets close in New York. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters see earnings for the quarter ended Dec. 31 at $27.8 million, or earnings per share of 19 cents, on $663.3 million in revenue.Excluding onetime charges, Tesla is expected to have lost 10 cents per share in the last quarter. The outlook among forecasters is varied, with Zacks and Standard & Poor’s seeing Tesla gaining 4 cents per share excluding onetime charges while Bloomberg has that estimate as a 4-cent loss.For the year, the Thomson Reuters poll expects the 10-year-old Palo Alto, Calif.-based automaker to report net profit of $85.7 million on $2.38 billion in revenue. Including one-time items, the company is expected to report a gain of 62 cents per share for the year; excluding the items, a loss of 73 cents.The broad difference between the EPS and fully reported EPS is in part due to the company’s resale value guarantee, a non-cash item that amounts to a future financial commitment that’s based on a third-party (in this case, ALG automotive) estimate of the future residual value of a post-lease Model S. The company is reporting so-called Model S revenue-deferral due to this lease accounting as part of its own quarterly revenue accounting. It\'s something that Generally Accepted Accounting Principle\xa0(GAAP) frowns upon. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission requires all companies to use both GAAP and non-GAAP, and to emphasize the GAAP numbers, then explain the non-GAAP differences later in the report.\xa0In the third quarter of 2013, revenue deferred due to lease accounting was $171 million, or 28 percent of the company’s total revenue of $602.6 million in the three months ended Sept. 30. That’s a two-percentage-point increase from the second quarter when the company first began revenue deferral due to lease accounting. It will be interesting to see how much this share has grown as a portion of total revenue in the last quarter of the year. That revenue is based on an assumption of the future residual value of some Model S sedans currently (and soon to be) in circulation. If those residual value estimates turn out to be too high, this could pose a problem later when Tesla is trying to recoup revenue of vehicles in the aftermarket.Look At Gross MarginOne of the most important short-term metrics in the earnings will be how much the company is making on the sale of each vehicle.There’s gross margin, and then there’s gross margin. One definition takes into consideration the revenue made from selling California ZEVs, or Zero Emission Vehicle Credits, and the other does not. In either case Tesla has done a good job increasing gross margins as it ramps up production and works out supply-chain kinks. The company reported 2012 gross margin of 7.3 percent. In the three months ended Sept. 30 it reported 23.9 percent, including the sale of carbon credits.CEO Elon Musk said in a November conference call regarding his company’s third-quarter results that he felt “pretty confident” about hitting 25 percent in the fourth quarter excluding ZEV credits, “unless there’s some force majeure event.” The gross margin forecast for the fourth quarter (excluding ZEV credits) stands at 25.2 percent and 21.6 percent for the year. If Tesla misses 25 percent for the quarter, it will be viewed negatively.“TSLA is in our estimation better on-course now to meet its 25 percent 4Q margin target than at any time prior (we had earlier been skeptical this metric could be met),” said J.P. Morgan analysts led by Ryan Brinkman, in their latest research note from November.Look At Unit Sales VolumeOn Jan. 14, Tesla announced in a significant guidance statement that sales in the fourth quarter “were the highest in company history by a significant margin” at 6,900 vehicles. This is positive news, but it does not distinguish between global and U.S. sales and, unlike long-established mass-market and luxury automakers, Tesla doesn\'t provide a monthly sales performance summary.\xa0California is Tesla’s largest single market right now. According to the California New Car Dealers Association, 8,347 Model S sedans were registered in the state last year, well over a third of all Model S sedans delivered in the U.S. But state vehicle registration figures for three consecutive quarters in 2013 showed declines in Model S registrations, to 1,793 in the last three months of the year.Tesla says it is addressing production constraints and is struggling to fill U.S. orders while also sending vehicles to key nascent markets in Europe and Asia. Watching California sales moving forward will help establish whether demand there has reached a plateau or whether there are just a lot of California buyers waiting for their cars to be delivered as Tesla expanded aggressively in 2013. (A recent survey of used car listings suggests current used, and very low mileage, Model S sedans are selling for more than the price for a new version with a waiting list.)\xa0Unless Tesla\'s policy has changed, there will not be a detailed breakdown of unit sales in Wednesday’s report beyond a quarterly estimate. Look for any guidance on global sales performance, however. Tesla may provide interesting details on China.\xa0Europe, SuperchargedIn Europe, the company is expanding its proprietary Supercharger network, which allows Model S owners to quickly recharge their batteries for free, in its most important market outside of the U.S. Tesla recently completed a coast-to-coast corridor that connects New York to Los Angeles via Chicago. Details in how it propagates its European network will be an important part of the report. Telsa has its focus on Northern European markets where consumers are more environmentally conscious and governments offer more enticing incentives for EV buyers -- at least for now.\xa0What About That Battery Supply?Tesla will likely address battery supply concerns in its report on Wednesday. Look for any mention of its relationship with Panasonic Corp. (TYO:6752), the company’s primary supplier of its battery cells. Any commentary on battery supply constraints and how the company is dealing with it, such as any plans to build its own production capability, would be big and probably welcome news.Tesla’s stock price lost 21 percent in the fourth quarter but has gained nearly 32 percent to $198.23 per share as of market close on Friday.\xa0']"

Raymann’s addition to the iWatch team suggests that Apple could be looking to enable the iWatch to track and improve sleep, while also tracking other health-related data.When it comes to Apple’s interests in the automotive industry, the Chronicle reported that Adrian Perica, the company’s mergers and acquisitions chief, met with Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk in Cupertino, Calif., last spring to discuss a potential buyout -- a matter that obviously also got the attention of analysts.“I know this is radical and potentially 'transformative' but this would radically alter Apple's growth profile,” Adnaan Ahmad, a German investment banking analyst, wrote in an “open letter” to Apple in October 2013, in which he urged the company to acquire Tesla.“In Elon Musk, you could strike up a partnership and obtain a new iconic partner to lead Apple's innovation drive.”Apple has shown some interest in automotive technologies in the past. The company unveiled its “iOS in the car” feature at the Worldwide Developers Conference in June -- a technology that allows users to connect their iOS devices to an in-car display either through wired or wireless connections.The technology also has led Apple into partnerships with car makers such as BMW (FRA:BMW), Daimler’s (FRA:DAI) Mercedes-Benz division, General Motors Co.

https://www.ibtimes.com/why-used-tesla-model-s-can-cost-more-new-one-tsla-1554000,Why A Used Tesla Model S Can Cost More Than A New One (TSLA),Angelo Young,02/07/14,12:10 PM,"['It’s common knowledge that a car begins to lose value from the moment it’s driven away from a showroom, but this isn’t necessarily the case with the Tesla Model S.According to an analysis of millions of used car listings in 2013 and 2014 by Boston-based iSeeCars, the Model S luxury electric sedan from Tesla Motors Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) can cost up to 20 percent over the average price of a new Model S sedan. \xa0    The average price of a used Model S is going for a premium over the price of a new one, according to an analysis of the used car online marketplace. The average mileage of a used Model S is under 4,000 miles. Are some early Model S adopters making a profit in the aftermarket?   “The average used Tesla Model S is selling for over $99,000, which is above the average of its new car MSRP,"" manufacturer’s suggested retail price, said Phong Ly, CEO of the online car-buying search engine. He used a search algorithm to scour 45 million online used car search listings to study the aftermarket value of the Model S and the Nissan Leaf, both fully electric cars, and the Chevrolet Volt, a plug-in hybrid with both electric and gasoline power.One factor contributing to the appreciated value of the Model S is that first-buyers in the U.S. benefit from a federal tax incentive that knocks $7,500 off the MSRP. Secondly, Tesla is grappling with production constraints, which means it can take months between the time a down payment on a Model S is made and when it’s delivered to the customer. What this means is that in this clique of wealthy, early-adopting electric vehicle enthusiasts, supply constraint is driving up the resale value.The study found that even the higher-end Performance Model S (more horsepower with the same 265-mile range of the 85 kWh battery pack) is pricing about the same used as it is new, at $106,800. Prices will vary depending on the options of any single used Model S, but clearly at this point buying used is not much of a bargain.The study also found the average mileage of a used Model S is very low, at 3,700 miles, which suggests some early adopters may be taking advantage of the aftermarket prices and unloading almost-new Model S sedans at a profit.\xa0']"

(NASDAQ:TSLA) has completed a record-setting cross-country trip from Los Angeles to New York City.\xa0The two Model S sedans set the first Guinness World Records-certified time for an electric vehicle crossing. The trip took 76 hours and five minutes, with 59 hours and 34 minutes of that time spent driving, 15 hours and 57 seconds spent charging and 34 minutes to put chains on the tires for crossing the snowy Vail Pass in Colorado.The 3,427-mile journey, which ended Sunday, was a coup for Tesla as it sought to prove the worth of its 73 super-charging stations across the country and to show that its growing fleet of cars could actually make such a grueling journey.While most of the chargers are around 130 miles apart on average, the Tesla team did have to travel 247 miles from Flagstaff, Ariz., to Blanding, Utah, at one point. Meanwhile, the longest drive time between charges was from Silverthorne, Colo., to Cheyenne, Wyo., because of an overnight blizzard that saw the team battle through 12 inches of snow, icy roads and high winds. Significant traffic delays and the closure of roads meant the two sedans had to take a detour.Between charges in Albert Lea, Minn., and La Crosse, Wis., the cars had to operate in -4F (-20C) temperatures, proving that the chargers and the car could withstand frigid conditions.\xa0According to Tesla, the trip saved 136 gallons of fuel and $435 against the average 25mpg car, assuming the price per gallon is $3.20.However, Tesla has a long way to go before breaking the record crossing for a normal fuel-powered car. Ed Bolian broke the record late in 2013 when he was able to make the same journey in 28 hours and 50 minutes, only stopping three times to refuel and use the rest room.Not only that, the company team were not the first to drive Teslas across the country. A father-daughter duo beat them to it last week.']"

(NASDAQ:TSLA) enjoys a steep price advantage for its electric Model S luxury sedan thanks to lucrative green-incentive discounts offered to buyers of electric cars.Now, as the Palo Alto, Calif.-based boutique automaker begins to make inroads into the Chinese luxury auto market it faces a different issue: steep duties and taxes that add nearly $37,000 to the cost of its vehicle.The company announced Thursday that its Chinese online ordering site is up and running and that the cost of the Model S it is offering there is no different than it is in the U.S. or Europe if one excludes the hefty add-ons from the Chinese government as well as the cost of delivery.Tesla said in a blog post Wednesday that it’s selling the Model S with the 85 kWh battery in China for $81,070, the same price the vehicle costs in the U.S. excluding the $7,500 federal tax credit. On top of the base price, Tesla is charging a $3,600 delivery fee. The final price tag, including the duties and VAT charge in China puts the price at 734,000 yuan (about $121,000).This may sound like a lot, but it’s a bargain compared to the typical mark-ups of imported luxury cars in China, and Tesla made sure to point that out.\xa0“We know that our competitors will try to convince Chinese consumers that our relatively lower price tag means the Model S is a lesser car, when the real reason their car costs more is that they make double the profit per car in China compared to the United States or Europe.An IBTimes review of luxury car listings in China last summer showed, for example, that a BMW X5 crossover was listing locally for $330,000 compared to just over $100,000 in the U.S., and that a BMW Mini Cooper can cost upward of $85,000 in China compared to about $52,000 in U.S.Tesla Is Using “Te Si La” On Its Chinese WebsiteIn related news, Tesla Motors has been fighting for its right to use certain trademarks in China where a local businessman by the name of Zhan Baosheng had beaten the automaker to the Chinese patent and trademark authority, registering the word ""Tesla,"" the Chinese equivalent transliteration “Te Si La,” Tesla\'s “T-shaped” badge and Tesla\'s ""Tesla Motors"" logo including the company\'s distinctive logo font. Zhan claims he is a legitimate businessman trying to make an electric car named after Nicola Tesla, the inventor of the AC current, but his history and other trademark filings suggest he is squatting on the marks to force Tesla to buy the right to use them.The company has remained mum about the ongoing trademark dispute in recent months, and as recently as last month Automotive News pointed out that Tesla is not using “Te Si La,” which is the closest phonetic transliteration of “Tesla.” But it does appear that the company is testing the waters in its right to use “Te Si La,” even if it\'s just a transliterated phrase rather than a registered trademark. Here you can see the company is using “Te Si La” in parentheses to translate the term “Tesla” that it displays in English letters.\xa0    The Chinese characters (circled) spell out ""Te Si La,"" a phrase Tesla would like to trademark but has been hampered by a local who was the first to file the mark with the trademark authority in China.  Photo: Tesla, IBTimes  Also, the Chinese tesla website (tesla.cn), where Zhan had been using the trademarks, was not active as of Thursday afternoon. Whether this means Tesla has been successful in its battle against Zhan is not known publicly at this time. Neither the company nor the local Chinese trademark authority has released any updates on this ongoing dispute.\xa0']"

In fact, the executives were granted new options to buy shares at Monday’s closing price of $139.34 pending future achievement of performance objectives. In addition, Gregory Reichow was granted options to buy shares, and was not actually granted shares. Also, Tesla's forecast of a flat operating profit in the fourth quarter should have been attributed to the Wall Street Journal.*Four of Tesla Motors' top executives were granted options to buy 385,000 shares of their company’s stock (NASDAQ:TSLA) on Monday at the day's closing price of $139.34, according to U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filings released late Wednesday.“Certain executives were granted new options as part of the company’s annual compensation review of its employees, which had been ongoing for some time,” Tesla director of global communications Liz Jarvis-Shean said by email on Thursday. “These grants were made in the ordinary course of Tesla’s business, under which new options are granted on the second Monday of each month.”A day after the issuance of new stock options, the Palo Alto, Calif.-based automaker announced record sales of its Model S luxury electric sedan in the fourth quarter of 2003 of nearly 6,900 units, exceeding prior guidance by 20 percent. The good news helped send Tesla’s stock price to $171.28 as of closing price Thursday, which added $12 million to the value of the stock options since Monday. Tesla will report its fourth-quarter 2013 earnings next month.Stock options are intended to retain top talent at companies and to align their interests with those of their shareholders. The executives will not be able to exercise the right to buy these shares until a later performance evaluation of the company. The stock is down nearly 7 percent over the past three months, but it’s up almost 23 percent since Monday.Here’s the breakdown options granted on Monday:Chief Technical Officer Jeffrey Straubel was granted the option to buy 220,000 shares that were worth $30.65 million on Monday and $37.6 million after markets closed in New York on Thursday.Vice President of Manufacturing Gregory Reichow was granted the option to buy 65,000 shares worth $9.06 million on Monday. Those shares are worth $11.11 million at market close on Thursday.\xa0Vice President for Service and Sales Operations Jerome Guillen was granted the option to buy 55,000 shares worth $7.66 million on Monday.

As of Thursday afternoon those shares were worth $7.69 million.According to the Wall Street Journal, Tesla says its operating profit for the fourth quarter will be about the same as in the third quarter. The company is investing heavily in expanding its global sales and marketing infrastructure, its network of quick-charging stations, known as Superchargers, in the U.S. and Europe, and works to expand capacity at its Fremont, Calif., factory.""]"

He added that there might be a upgrade option similar to the Model S\'s 60 kWh battery (208 miles) and 85 kWh battery (265 miles) choices. Also, when asked if it\'s better to refer to the lower-cost Tesla electic car expected out in 2017 as the ""Gen 3"" or the ""Model E"" (a name Tesla trademarked last year) he said it\'s better to call it the ""Gen 3"" for now, implying that Tesla has not publicly confirmed the name of the vehicle.*Jerome Guillen, Telsa Motors Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) head of global sales, wouldn’t say Tuesday what the range of the company’s planned lower-cost electric vehicle, dubbed the “Gen 3,” would be, but his answer indicated that it’s not likely to meet the same range expectation seen in the luxury Model S sedan.“It will have a practical range,” he demurred, when asked by International Business Times during a question-and-answer session at the 2014 Detroit Auto Show, saying customers would be satisfied with what the company has planned for a $40,000 electric car, due out in 2017.The range of the upcoming lower-cost Tesla electric vehicle is important to the company in light of the current and upcoming mix of smaller electric vehicles. For example, the Nissan Leaf, the most popular electric vehicle in history based on sales volume, has a range of about 75 miles with a starting price of $28,800. The BMW i3, which will go on sale in the U.S. later this year, has a range of about 80 miles for a base price of about $41,000. For Tesla to succeed in the market for smaller, nonluxury EVs, it will need to meet or exceed the ranges of cars in that segment that will be out in 2017.Guillen is indicating that the Model E will not hit the current 208-mile range of the Model S, or the 265-mile range of the higher-priced 85 kWh battery packs. However, Tesla uses different batteries than the ones used by current smaller EVs, so under current technology it’s likely that if Tesla’s Model E were available today it would, like the Model S, be a segment leader in electric range. The question is how well competing models in the mass-market EV segment, such as the Leaf, i3, Chevy Spark, Ford Focus electric and others, will do to boost range over the next three years.Tesla’s Fourth-Quarter Sales Exceeded ExpectationsGuillen also announced that Tesla delivered 6,900 Model S sedans in the fourth quarter of last year, 20 percent more than the company’s prior guidance. This means Tesla sold 22,900 Model S sedans, more than the 21,000 CEO Elon Musk had said earlier this year he expected to deliver.Two New Superchargers Went Online TuesdayThe company is now two steps closer to a coast-to-coast corridor of its Supercharger network that will provide Model S owners free power to drive from New York to Los Angeles via Chicago.Musk Tweets: Model S Was Not RecalledIn related news, Musk Tweeted Tuesday:\xa0Some confusion in media reports today.

https://www.ibtimes.com/tesla-supercharger-network-least-six-more-supercharger-stations-are-needed-connect-us-1532180,Tesla Supercharger Network: At Least Six More Supercharger Stations Are Needed To Connect US Coasts For Free Model S Electricity [MAP],Angelo Young,01/08/14,1:13 PM,"[""The Associated Press made a big deal recently about the opening of one of Tesla’s quick-charging stations in Lusk, Wy., a small town about 100 miles east of Casper city near Interstate Highway 25.“There's no shortage of skepticism about electric cars out here -- it's not the kind of place for electric cars,” wrote AP’s Mead Gruver under a Huffington Post headline that reads “Tesla Now Wants To Conquer The American Heartland.”“Conquer the American heartland,” is an overstatement, as is the idea the company has any plans to specifically target Wyoming or any other sparsely populated, pickup-truck heavy parts of the U.S. with a luxury electric car.The reason for establishing Tesla Supercharger stations, which offer free electricity to Model S owners, in the boondocks of the western United States is part of a larger strategy to lay out a coast-to-coast route via Chicago that can serve Tesla’s core consumer base: wealthy urbanites who are willing to fork out luxury car prices to become early adopters of the first electric car in history to top 200 miles in range.And as the map above shows, the boutique electric car company based in Palo Alto, Calif.,\xa0is about six stations shy of offering a corridor between New York and Los Angeles. The reason Tesla is building Supercharger stations across the large western states is because the company’s directors made a strategic decision to connect Los Angeles with Chicago. To do so, the corridor must cut in the northeasterly direction from L.A. following major interstates, which takes the route though Wyoming and South Dakota. Lusk is just one link in a chain that has little to do with conquering the “Heartland” of America.Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced in September that he plans to take a coast-to-coast road trip with his family relying solely on his Supercharger stations. So far this trip would be impossible. (Click here to read about five round-trips that were possible last month relying solely on Superchargers.) But at the rate at which Tesla is building these $500,000 stations, it’s only a matter of weeks if not days before a Model S owner will be able to travel from New York to Chicago to Los Angeles to Vancouver without paying for fuel. And if they want, they can stop by Lusk, grab a bite, maybe visit nearby Mount Rushmore, and spend some of that money they saved to help the local economy.\xa0""]"

That’s 5.6 percent of all passenger cars and light trucks bought in 2013.By comparison, the market share of zero-emission plug-in electric vehicles in the U.S. stands at less than 1 percent. While electric cars worldwide largely depend on fossil fuel for their battery charges, they are more environmentally friendly than cars that have internal combustion because they don’t have exhaust pipes churning out carbon monoxide and micro-particles that cause respiratory problems when emitted in large concentrations, such as in dense urban environments.Norway's generous tax breaks for electric vechiles has led to a relative boom in EVs there, but they still make up a small (but growing) share of the total market. The incentives also raise questions about the viability of EVs. Would Norwegians buy as many of them them if they didn't receive special treatment? How would EVs fare without government nudges?    Sales of the Nissan Leaf electric vehicle in Norway has grown significantly from 2012. Almost 60 percent of all EVs sold in the country last year were Leafs.  Photo: IBTimes using official data from Norway's OFV  The Nissan Leaf continues to capture the largest portion of the ZEV (zero-emission vehicles) market in Norway, the only country in the world where government incentives make EVs less expensive than their comparable fuel-burning counterparts and that offers other perks, namely free parking and ferry rides and a lower annual registration and inspection fees.Nissan Motor Co. Ltd. (TYO:7201) has seen sales of its Leaf plug-in compact city car, the best-selling all-electric vehicle ever, explode in Norway thanks to the government incentives that makes its Leaf cheaper than its closest internal-combustion-engine competitor, the Volkswagen Golf. The Golf is still the best-selling car in Norway overall, but in December the Leaf fell into second place for the first time. Just over 58 percent of all EVs bought in Norway last year were Leafs.    Tesla Model S sales in Norway have topped 500 units in the three of the five months the vehicle has been on sale there. Tesla began marketing its car en force in August. Since then  Photo: IBTimes using official data from Norway's OFV  The Model S luxury electric sedan by U.S. boutique electric carmaker Tesla Motors Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) has made significant bounds in Norway since the car went on sale en force in August. Despite a supply hiccup in October Tesla managed to deliver 1,983 units last year, most of them in September, November and December. That represents about a fourth of all EVs bought in Norway last year.This makes Norway Tesla’s largest overseas market right now. The reason is simple: Norway is the only market where the Model S costs significantly less than comparable luxury fuel-burning cars. While buyers are eligible for tax breaks in the U.S. for buying EVs, in Norway, EVs are exempt from hefty government taxes and fees that are characteristic of countries with high consumption taxes and a large social safety net.""]"

(NASQDAQ:TSLA) is scrambling to connect the East and West Coast of the U.S. through its national network of Supercharger stations that provide complimentary battery re-ups to Model S owners.The stations offer high speed recharges and are an important part of Tesla’s selling point: that eventually Model S drivers will be able to refuel for free from hundreds of Superchargers across the United States and Western Europe. Currently most of the West Coast is adequately covered to take road trips without paying for fuel, but the network is still too threadbare for drivers to rely exclusively on Tesla’s own charging stations on long-distance drives.Tesla doesn’t say how much it’s spending to build these stations, but in its last quarterly report, issued Nov. 5, the company cited growing expenses related to building out its network of stores, service centers and Supercharger infrastructure. In the third quarter ended Sept. 30, Tesla spent $77 million on these projects, up from $37.8 million thanks to this year’s aggressive European expansion efforts.Since Dec. 12 the Palo Alto-based luxury electric carmaker has added five new stations to its map: one near San Francisco, one in New Mexico west of Albuquerque, one in eastern Wyoming, one in southern South Dakota, and one in Chicago.Three of the stations – the ones in New Mexico, Wyoming and South Dakota – are putting Tesla three steps closer to giving Model S drivers the ability to travel a specific route between Los Angeles and New York, via a swing up the Western states of New Mexico, Colorado, Wyoming and South Dakota, through Chicago, and then east through northern Indiana and Ohio and across Pennsylvania. \xa0The map above is the latest Tesla Supercharger network with the new stations circled in green. The green arrows indicate gaps that need to be filled before a Model S driver could on this very specific route go from one coast to the other without paying for electric fuel.Getting free ""fuel"" probably isn’t a big deal for the wealthy Model S owners, but they would be concerned about being stranded in the middle of the desert in Utah with no charging options in sight. This is perhaps one reason why the nascent coast-to-coast route is tracking through some of the lesser populated Western states where an electric-car driver would be lucky to encounter an RV park or third-party charging station from which to juice-up the battery pack.\xa0']"

(NASDAQ:TSLA), it’s not surprising that it tops the list of most popular auto-company searches on Google. The Palo Alto, Calif.-based luxury electric-sedan maker accelerated its global expansion this year, began fleshing out its network of complimentary quick-charge stations in the U.S. and Europe, and defended against any insinuations about the safety of the Model S sedan following three high-profile car fires in the fourth quarter. \xa0On top of actual and relevant company-related news, the Tesla CEO and founder Elon Musk maintained a strong media presence with his occasional pontifications on the future of transport and space exploration that kept his name, and the names of his companies, Tesla, SpaceX and SolarCity, alive in the press and in the public’s collective awareness. This year, Musk’s face graced the covers of Time, The Atlantic and Forbes, and writers – more than aware of Tesla’s ability to attract Web traffic – pushed out copy on every conceivable angle to the Tesla narrative.Interesting to note that queries pertaining to the price of the Model S was one of the more popular Tesla-related search queries. In case you’re wondering: In the U.S. the vehicle’s base price is $63,570 for the 60 kWh (208-mile rage) battery; $73,570 for the 85 kWh, 265-mile-range battery; and $87,070 for the Performance model that has extra horsepower and acceleration. The prices exclude any local or federal electric-vehicle incentives, which lower the price, as well as any options that could quickly turn the Model S into a six-figure luxury car.Following Tesla, the second-most popular query of auto manufacturers in 2013 was Bugatti, the French maker of the Veyron Grand Sport Vitesse, which in April officially became the fastest street-legal roadster in the world at just over 254 miles per hour. Considering the $1.3 million price tag for the Grand Sport Vitesse, it’s safe to assume people are searching for Bugatti to fantasize about being behind the wheel of the Jozej Kaban-designed head-turning two-door coupe.The Mini Cooper from Germany’s Daimler AG (FRA:DAI) came in as the third-most popular Google search query for auto manufacturers, helped along by the buzz behind the revamped range of Minis due out next year. The new Minis will be larger, adding more interior space. The John Cooper Works Concept Mini, scheduled to be revealed at the Detroit auto show next month, also added to the interest.Ford Motor Co. (NYSE:F) took the cake as the most popular major auto manufacturer, thanks in large part to the U.S. obsession with the company’s F-150 pickup truck, the best-selling vehicle in the country. The Ford Focus sedan, Explorer SUV and Escape compact crossover were top searches related to Ford.Here are the other six top auto manufacturer queries submitted to Google this year:Jeep and DodgeOwing to the popularity of the Cherokee, Grand Cherokee and Wrangler, Jeep ranked as the fifth-most popular auto-company-related search query. It’s one of two of Chrysler Group LLC’s divisions to make it to the top 10 list this year. Dodge came in at No. 8 thanks to the mass appeal for its Ram pickup truck, the reintroduced Dart sedan and the Challenger muscle car.ToyotaThe world’s top automaker by sales volume – the only automaker to have topped 10 million in unit sales in a year – ranks No. 6 on the list of top auto-company Google queries. The Camry, the world’s best-selling sedan, was a big reason for the interest. Also, the 2014 Corolla that was introduced this year helped generate interest in the Japanese auto giant. The Tacoma pickup truck was also a focus of Toyota-related searches. \xa0GMCThe only search query related to General Motors Co. (NYSE:GM) to make the list was for the division responsible for the GMC Sierra pickup truck, the Yukon SUV and the Acadia crossover. Top news-related searches for GMC focused on the 2014 Sierra, the company’s trucks and the Denali nameplate.Subaru and MazdaThe smaller Japanese automakers beat out Honda and Nissan, which didn’t make the list this year. Subaru’s Impreza and the Impreza’s performance variants, the WRX and the WRX STI, helped peak online interest. The Outback wagon and Forester crossover – two models with strong owner loyalty – were also top Subaru-related searches. The Mazda3 compact, the Mazda6 full sized sedan – both having received major updates for the 2014 model year – attracted enough interest to put the 17th-largest automaker near the top of the Google search pile for 2013.\xa0']"

The total price of gasoline for these trips in a comparable gas burning full sized luxury sedan would cost around $1,300.  Photo: IBTimes  Tesla Motors Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is busying building out its Supercharger network in North America and Europe, but it still has a long way to go before it covers either region completely.Similar to the way telecommunications companies gradually built out their cellular coverage networks over time, Tesla is adding its charging stations strategically, building each station with an eye toward servicing the largest number of customers at a time.Nearly half of all current Supercharger stations, where Model S owners can quickly charge their car compliments of Telsa, are dotted along the West Coast. Much ado was made last month when Telsa completed enough of its West Coast quick-charge stations to take a driver from Vancouver to Tijuana.While it’s technically true this journey is possible, the Model S maximum range of 265 miles isn’t enough to get you back from Tijuana to the nearest station in Los Angeles, which is roughly a 280-mile round trip. On the return trip a driver would have to plug in at a third-party charging station, an RV park, or other source somewhere on your way back to L.A.Which begs a question: where in the U.S. can Model S owners drive their cars right now, round trip, without paying anything for fuel?Here are five round-trip, free-fuel road trips that are possible right now. These road trips assume you’re starting with a fully charged Model S with the extended 265-mile range, sticking to main routes. The Supercharger network is still too small in most cases for owners to completely rely on free charging, but these road trips would be technically possible without using any electricity except what is provided by a Tesla Supercharger. \xa0Seattle to Los Angeles, 2,200 miles round tripThis is by far the easiest road trip to take relying solely on the Tesla Supercharger network. There are 15 charging stations all along the West Coast, which gives drivers the greatest amount of latitude to take scenic side trips and still get back to a Supercharger for a free top-off.Minneapolis to Chicago, 818 miles round tripThere isn’t a Supercharger in Minneapolis yet, but thanks to the one that opened last week in Mauston, Wis., 198 miles away, a Model S can make the trip to Chi-Town and back, though in the 60 kWh Model S (which has a 208-mile range), that trip to and from the nearest station from Minneapolis would be a gamble.New York City to Raleigh, 1,000 miles round tripThere are six active Supercharger stations between Darien, Conn., 46 miles north of New York City, and Charlotte, N.C. But getting to Charlotte, North Carolina’s southernmost city, is just out of reach for a return to the Supercharger station in Rocky Mount, N.C. But Raleigh and back is 118 miles, leaving more than enough power to get back.Jacksonville to Miami, 690 miles round tripFlorida has three Supercharger stations, according to Tesla’s latest quick-charger map, enough to traverse much of the East Coast of the Sunshine State. The Supercharger station in Port St. Lucie connects Miami to the state’s border with South Carolina. The station in Fort Meyers on the state’s southern Gulf Coast allows free travel across the peninsula north of Lake Okeechobee.The Texas Triangle, 710 miles Five strategically placed Texas Supercharger stations in Waco, Corsicana, Huntsville, San Marcos and Columbus allows easy travel from Dallas to San Antonio to Houston and back to Dallas, covering most of the state’s largest cities. Free-fuel long distance travel is possible around this geographic triangle.So how much would it cost to drive these 5,418 miles in a gasoline burner? In a Lexus LS -- a comparable gas burning full-sized luxury sedan – it would cost $1,288 worth of fuel, according to the latest estimate of regional average fuel prices by the American Automobile Association.""]"

Thai makes the Model S a relative bargain for the wealthy Norwegians than can afford a six-figure set of wheels.  Photo: IBTimes chart  Tesla Motors Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) has really focused heavily on Norway as it expands its global operations. And with good reason: the Model S electric luxury sedan is a bargain compared to comparable gas burners in one of the world’s most environmentally progressive countries.Now some Norwegians are wondering if providing huge incentives for a car bought by high net worth individuals is really in keeping with the spirit of the carrots the government is dangling in front of consumers to lure them toward greener modes of personal motorized transportation.The Norwegian new site Budstikka published on Thursday a profile of the first 100 Model S owners in the country and found that their average annual income is 1.55 million Danish krone (about $285,500), or 82 percent above the approximately $157,000 median in the two municipalities that have the highest concentration of Tesla cars in the country.At the same time, these wealthy EV drivers enjoy breaks on levies the government imposes on vehicle purchases to the tune of about $135,000 for the Model S, which has a local starting base price of about $112,000. In other words, if the Model S had a gas engine, like comparable luxury cars, it would cost nearly $250,000 to own one in Norway.It’s no wonder Tesla CEO Elon Musk has made the northern European country a priority and why the Model S has sold so much better there than in other European markets. Electric vehicle owners not only are exempt from the hefty government taxes and fees on car purchases but also enjoy the legal use of bus lanes, free transport by ferry and a discount on the annual car tax. The economic incentives are set to expire in 2017 unless the government decides to extend them.Erik Figenbaum, a researcher at Norway’s Institute of Transport Economics at the Norwegian Centre for Transport Research, questions whether the current incentives would be the same had a six-figure luxury EV been on the market when incentive began being introduced in 2001 to promote EV use.“At the time [when incentive were being introduced] they were talking about simpler electric vehicles,” Figenbaum told Budstikka.The incentives were created when the only EVs that were available in Norway were more economical models like the Nissan Leaf, the Mitsubishi i-MiEV and the domestically produced Think and Buddy city cars. Tesla kicked off its Model S sales and marketing operations in August and the vehicle has already outsold the total 2012 volumes for all EV brands on the market except the Nissan and the Mitsubishi.\xa0""]"

(NASDAQ:TSLA) has been doing with its lease program this year is a textbook example of how companies add revenue to their books in a way that doesn't comply with generally accepted accounting practices (GAAP).Since the Palo Alto, Calif.-based maker of the Model S electric luxury sedan began leasing its vehicles earlier this year through a deal with U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) and Wells Fargo & Co. (NYSE:WFC), it has reported tens of millions of dollars of “deferred” revenue and “deferred” gross profit.In the quarter ended Sept. 30, the company reported $171.2 million in revenue from this deferred lease accounting, compared with $431.6 million in revenue from selling its cars and other products and services.In other words, the company is reporting revenue and income on what it expects to recover when it sells used Model S sedans from lease customers in the aftermarket (when they return their vehicles after 36 to 39 months). This creative accounting is an example of a non-GAAP (often called “adjusted” in the media) measure. Tesla isn’t violating any rules by doing this, because it offers both GAAP and non-GAAP accounting in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.Now, according to a report Wednesday in the Wall Street Journal, the SEC has established a task force to look into how companies report non-GAAP numbers, possibly as a lead into enacting enforcement measures. Speaking at an event hosted by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants in Washington, D.C.,\xa0David Woodcock, chairman of the SEC's new Financial Reporting and Audit Task Force, did not name any specific company. He did say one focus would be to examine if companies use financial terms with common meanings in different contexts to mislead investors.The use of non-GAAP accounting is prevalent among, but not isolated to, technology startups, which often remove certain items like taxes in their non-GAAP accounting to turn a loss into a profit. Another common non-GAAP measure is reporting stock-based compensation expenses as gains in a quarter when insiders who have been given options to buy stock at below-market value (as part of their compensation) exercise them when the stock is rising.The SEC task force was created in July and is comprised of 12 attorneys and accountants.""]"

(NADAQ:TSLA) did much better in Norway last month than it did in October, when deliveries of its Model S dropped significantly from the previous month.November deliveries of the luxury electric sedan to the environmentally progressive country came in at 527 units, according to OFV, Norway’s automotive association. This is a leap from the 98 cars delivered in October, which was a big drop from September’s 606 units.Tesla began selling its critically acclaimed vehicle in Norway in August, and early deliveries there are certain to have a significant number of pre-order sales collected by Tesla over the past year from eager early adopters.November’s Model S sales data indicate that October’s lackluster volume is due to Tesla’s current battery cell supply problems that have constrained Tesla’s ability to meet current demand.“The main constraint on our production is really the cells,” CEO Elon Musk said during a Nov. 5 conference call following the company’s third-quarter earnings report. Each Model S contained thousands of lithium-ion cells manufactured by Panasonic Corp. (TYO:6752). Tesla recently signed a deal with the Osaka, Japan-based electronics manufacturer to acquire 2 billion of these cells through 2017, enough to manufacture well over 250,000 vehicles.Norway has been a focal point of Tesla’s recent European expansion because the country has a high number of wealthy households that can afford a car with a starting price tag of 69,440 euros ($94,341) excluding any government incentives. In Norway those incentives are very attractive as they can push the local price of an EV below that of a comparable petrol-burner. EV owners in Norway also enjoy perks like free parking and ferry rides.Sales figures for the Tesla Model S are more difficult to come by than figures for established vehicle brands. Tesla releases approximated figures quarterly, so tracking Tesla’s total monthly sales volume is tricky, because not every country reports Tesla model sales volume.Germany, for example, still doesn’t list Tesla separately. The country’s Federal Motor Vehicle Office says only that 757 electric vehicles were delivered last month, a 146 percent increase from November 2012. The U.K.’s Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders also doesn’t list Tesla sales, but it reported only 35 imported vehicle deliveries last month. Denmark’s auto imports trade association does list Tesla: 32 Model S sedans were sold there last month, for a total of 79 sold there to date.Like Norway, the Netherlands does list Telsa Model S sales. The country’s Bicycle and Automobile Industry Association data shows a similar drop in Model S sales in October, to 32 units, followed by a steep increase last month to 408 units. Tesla has sold 618 of its vehicles in the first three months of sales in Holland, far outpacing other EVs in the market.\xa0']"

https://www.ibtimes.com/model-s-car-fires-tesla-gets-safety-nod-german-motor-safety-watchdog-1492226,Model S Car Fires: Tesla Gets Safety Nod From German Motor Safety Watchdog,Angelo Young,12/02/13,6:30 PM,"['The Germans have chimed in on the safety of the Tesla Model S luxury electric sedan: They say there’s no need for them to look further into any inordinate fire risk from puncturing the vehicle’s undercarriage battery tray.A letter from the German Federal Motor Transport Authority dated Nov. 27 but posted Monday by Tesla Motors Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) after the Thanksgiving break states the following: “No manufacturer-related defects could be found. ... Therefore, no further measures under the German Product Safety Act are deemed necessary.”Three high-profile Model S electric sedan fire incidents since Oct. 1 led the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Authority to launch a “preliminary evaluation” last month into whether the vehicle poses any unusual fire risk in the event of an “undercarriage strike with metallic roadway debris.”Two of the three incidents, one on Oct. 1 in Kent, Wash., and the other in Smyrna, Tenn., on Nov. 6, involved such a strike from roadside debris that led to what appears to have been a thermal runaway event involving some of the thousands of 18650 size lithium batteries made by Japan’s Panasonic Corp. (TYO:6752).Tesla contends its cars pose no more fire risk from collisions than any others, and so far no government or independent regulator has found any reason to declare otherwise. The third Tesla fire incident, in Merida, Mexico, on Oct. 17, appears to document the effects of a thermal runaway event with a secondary flare-up, but the fire was soon extinguished with no injuries related to the fire. (The driver was injured by the high-speed collision, then left the scene of the accident intoxicated, according to local Spanish-language news reports.)RELATED: Due to all the recent hype and attention around Tesla, which might sell 22,000 cars this year, a YouTube video dated from January 2012 has been making the rounds showing what can happen to a conventional car in the event of an undercarriage strike with metallic roadside debris. This incident might not have resulted in a car fire like it might have with a Model S, but on the other hand a dense Model S battery pack would have blocked this metal from cabin penetration, an event that could have killed its driver.

Ltd. (TYO:7267) and Toyota Motor Corp. (TYO:7203) have long been committed to the technology, which draws power from a chemical reaction between oxygen and hydrogen to power an electric motor, the timeline seems ambitious considering the challenges.But the industry isn’t resting on its laurels. If HFC cars are a viable alternative for the future of driving, automakers have to plan well ahead for its adoption. After all, it can take years to turn a technical concept into a mass-produced machine, and manufacturers that don’t foresee the adoption of the new technology will spend years playing catch-up later on.Honda unveiled its latest HFC experiment at the Los Angeles motor show, the FCEV concept car, which it says will be the basis for a commercial vehicle it intends to sell in the U.S. within two years. Not to be outmatched, Toyota said last week its FCV concept car, a four-seater sedan, would be available in the marketplace by 2015.Last year, some auto industry representatives were talking boldly at a hydrogen fuel conference in Toronto about HFC cars in dealer showrooms by this year. South Korean automaker Hyundai Motor Co. (KRX:005380), which joined Toyota and Honda in showing an HFC vehicle at the Tokyo Motors Show, has said in the past it would have 1,000 HFC vehicles on the road sometime between 2012 and 2015. Now it has scaled back those ambitions and says it will follow Honda’s lead by introducing the Tucson Fuel Cell under a Southern California lease program.Honda has had a proof-of-concept leasing program for its FCX Clarity – a six-figure hydrogen-powered Civic – since 2009. Honda is keeping its Clarity sales figures under wraps, but news reports since 2009 suggest Honda has well under 100 leases in the U.S.Last year, the German maker of Mercedes-Benz, Daimler AG (ETR:DAI) opened a hydrogen fuel cell component factory in British Columbia and this year partnered with Renault-Nissan to bring an HFC vehicle to market as early as 2017, so clearly automakers are moving forward despite the challenges.And there are big challenges. First and foremost: There are only 10 public HFC fueling depots in the U.S., most clustered in Southern California to serve those Honda and (soon) Hyundai HFC customers. Europe doesn’t fare much better.Any automaker that intends to mass market a retail-level HFC vehicle will face the same challenge Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) has had: addressing the lack of fueling outlets. Will Honda or any other automaker have to follow Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s lead by building their own hydrogen fueling outlets? A third party private sector developer isn’t likely to step forward until demand for hydrogen is high enough to support an industry. The government will most certainly have to play a role in incentivizing the infrastructure in the meantime.Another, even bigger challenge: farming hydrogen. There are very few free hydrogen molecules in the atmosphere and farming hydrogen is an energy-intensive process that typically relies on fossil fuels. When, and if, HFC vehicles take off, hydrogen production will have to take off, too. And then there’s the whole issue of a national distribution network – how to deliver compressed hydrogen gas from where it’s produced to where it can be injected into HFC vehicles.For the time being HFC technology is going to exist on the periphery of an industry that seems focused on developing electric vehicles. Whether hydrogen fuel cell technology takes off or not, the mainstreaming of HFC-powered cars is a long way from becoming a reality.\xa0']"

Lengthening the i3 would be easy, as it would only require using longer aluminum pieces for the chassis, extruding a longer shell to put on top of the frame and adjusting the rear door.No further details are provided other than speculation that this vehicle would be available sometime in 2015.After a century of effort, electric vehicles seem to be growing into a viable niche, especially for urban transport where parking and vehicular emissions are bigger issues than they are in the country, where electric vehicle range is a bigger concern.Telsa Motors Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) has said all along that it was starting with the Model S luxury sedan in order to scale toward making a lower-cost EV for the mass market. The big question will be whether the smaller so-called Gen 3 car can exceed its peers in range. Tesla’s Model S has the range thanks to its undercarriage tray containing thousands of 18650 lithium-ion cells that helps push the price tag toward, and in some cases beyond, six figures.One of the main reasons why other, less costly electric cars on the market don’t come close to the Model S’ 208-to-265-mile range is the size of the battery packs and the types of batteries used. Essentially, automakers such as Nissan, with its Leaf subcompact, have chosen to build smaller, lighter EVs using cheaper lithium-ion battery tech. Tesla will likely need to greatly exceed its peer in range in its sub-$40,000 model, to be out by 2016. Will Tesla be able to top 100 miles or even 200 miles of range for under $40,000? That’s an important question when talking about range and segment types.Meanwhile, it seems that BMW is fine with making a small EV with sub-100-mile range (albeit a pricey one, starting at over $40,000 and heading to $50,000 with add-ons, including a gas-powered range extending motor), and the company says demand for the i3 has surpassed 10,000 units ahead of its arrival to North America in the spring. The company said recently it has doubled production of carbon fiber from its Moses Lake, Wash., factory to meet the demand.The i8 hybrid plug-in (with a meager 22 miles of electric only range) expected out by the middle of next year is already sold out for 2014, Ian Robertson, global sales boss at BMW, speaking at the L.A. Auto Show last week, told Reuters.Whether BMW or any other automaker will beat Tesla to the punch in making a lower cost EV with the price and feel of entry-level luxury has yet to be seen, but one thing is certain: by the time that Gen 3 is on the market there are going to be Gen 3 competitors on the market, too. That’s not something the Model S is contending with right now.']"

Any car, Model S or not Model S, the underside is going to get significantly damaged if you drive over a large metal object.""Original story begins here:No, Telsa, cars can\'t exceed five safety-rating stars.At least that’s what the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has said about Tesla’s claim it gave the Model S the highest safety rating of any car in history, at 5.4 “stars.”The NHTSA, which announced on Monday that it’s launching a “preliminary evaluation” into the two Tesla Model S fires reported in the U.S. in October, released Thursday stricter guidelines on how automakers, dealer and advertising agencies can spin the agency’s various safety ratings.While the NHTSA didn\'t name any specific automakers, one sentence appears to be directed right at Tesla: “An advertisement should not claim that a vehicle earned a rating higher than 5-stars.”The announcement puts to rest a disagreement between Tesla and the agency over Tesla’s use of the raw crash-test data, known as the Vehicle Safety Score. Tesla is right to say that the Model S has earned the highest vehicle-safety score ever, but apparently where it flubbed was to imply the NHTSA gives above-five-star ratings.This is what Tesla said\xa0in August, after the five-star rating was announced by the safety watchdog.“NHTSA does not publish a star rating above 5, however safety levels better than 5 stars\xa0are\xa0captured in the overall Vehicle Safety Score (VSS) provided to manufacturers, where the Model\xa0S achieved a new combined record of 5.4 stars.”A lot of Tesla fans would see this as nitpicking by the NHTSA -- after all nobody\'s arguing that the Model S earned the highest vehicle-safety score ever. Though, as the New York Times “Wheels” blog pointed out in August, the Model S sedan’s top safety score comes with the price of the car:“The money spent on engineering and building the luxury car is also a factor [in its high safety rating], and that may be harder to replicate in E.V.’s aimed at the mass market.”The Model S starts in the U.S. at $64,570 for the 205-mile range and $73,570 for 265 miles per charge. The question is: when Tesla starts making that mass market lower-priced EV, will it be able to provide ideal range and equivalent safety ratings?The NHTSA announcement also outlines how its ratings can be presented in advertising. For example, advertisers must make clear the different ratings for different crash scenarios. For example, if the frontal-crash rating is provided, the right-front crash rating must accompany it in order to clarify the differences, or auto sellers can use the combined frontal rating, which the NHTSA also provides. The purpose is to avoid the practice of sellers that cherry-pick the highest-ratings numbers that could mislead the public on exactly which type of crash scenario is getting the rating.The NHTSA also said sellers can\'t mislead the public by juking the numbers. Apparently, there have been instances where sellers have combined two ratings to get numbers of stars above five. For example,a seller might say a car has “seven stars” for side impacts by adding together four stars for side impacts to the front seating position and three stars for the same impact on the rear-seating position.A SERIES OF POPPING SOUNDSMeanwhile, the NHTSA’s investigation is a big question mark right now. While the vehicle’s structural integrity is no longer in question, the company’s use of about 7,000 individual 18650-sized (a little bigger than a typical AA) battery cells manufactured by Panasonic Corporation (TYO:6752) to power the vehicle could fall under NHTSA scrutiny; or not -- that verdict is still out until the agency issues another decision.“Batteries in an electric car are maintained at a high state of charge to maximize driving range. Unfortunately, that practice also maximizes the potential for a field failure event,” writes John Petersen, executive vice president of ePower Engine Systems, a maker of hybrid drivetrains for heavy trucks, in his column on Seeking Alpha. “Since Tesla wanted its cars to have the longest possible driving range with the lowest possible battery weight, it chose a relatively unstable high-energy battery chemistry while its competitors who make electric cars with shorter ranges chose safer and more stable chemistries.”\xa0The Nissan Leaf, the most popular EV based on sales volume, uses 192 less volatile lithium-ion batteries to give the sub-$35,000 subcompact its roughly 80 miles of range, which greatly reduces the chances of a thermal runaway event where one cell is punctured, short circuits, flares up, causing the next cells to catch fire and so on like a string of firecrackers. (The video of the Tesla Model S fire in Yucatan Mexico on Oct. 16 shows what appears to be a thermal runaway event involving a series of popping sounds followed by a secondary flare-up after the fire started.)Petersen is drawing his information from an October 2012 study on vehicle-battery safety, a kind-of roadmap on the different types of battery systems used in EVs by Daniel Doughty of Albuquerque-based Battery Safety Consulting Inc. and Ahmad Pesaran of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory.\xa0']"

(TYO:7203), the world’s top automaker, grabbed the spotlight on the first day of the 2013 Tokyo Motor Show Wednesday by telling the world it\'s ready to mass-produce a hydrogen fuel cell car by 2015 locally and a year later globally.Toyota is one of 32 car and motorcycle manufacturers showing off their wares this year, with a strong emphasis on eco-friendliness from our mechanical steeds.Executive Vice President Mitsuhisa Kato presented the latest iteration of the fuel cell vehicle that Toyota has been kicking around recent auto shows. It looks more refined than the shell of the car seen in Detroit in January, where the engine compartment was being used to store expo brochures and only a model of the car’s fuel cell engine was on display separately. The vehicle on display in Tokyo couldn’t have been driven off the stage either, but it clearly looks more ready for that than previous iterations.Many inside and outside of the industry still see hydrogen fuel cell technology as nowhere near ready for prime time two years from now, if ever. A lot of things have to happen before an HFC vehicle could be driven around with even the restrictive ranges and routes of current electric vehicles on the market. And despite nearly 15 years of work by Honda Motor Co. (TYO:7267) and its Fuel Cell eXperimental project, today an FCX Clarity (think: zero-emission Honda Civic that costs more than souped-up zero-emission Tesla Model S sedan) is as likely to be seen on a U.S. highway as a horse and buggy.One of the biggest hurdles in hydrogen fuel cell technology is simply building out the infrastructure that would allow owners of these cars to refuel wherever they travel with them. The other problem is cost – Toyota says its FCV would be priced between $50,000 and $100,000, hardly a bargain, especially for a car that appears to be heading for entry-level luxury at best. And thirdly, HFC would probably face much of the same scrutiny Tesla Motors Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is currently facing – justified or not. If the image of flaming lithium-ion batteries is causing some stock-pummeling jitters for Tesla, imagine what an exploding tank of compressed hydrogen gas would cause.Honda, which led the way in the push for HFC back in 1999, hasn’t given up. It too is talking hydrogen in both Tokyo and at the L.A. Auto Show that’s happening at the same time, and it is promising an HFC car by 2015 based on the concept car it’s unveiling this week. Joining Toyota and Honda on the HFC bandwagon is Hyundai Motor Co. (KRX:005380) which says it will soon unveil its own HFC car.""The fuel cell solution … sort of brings together the best features of [internal combustion engines] and the best features of battery electric vehicles,"" Hyundai North America CEO John Krafcik recently told reporters. ""It is very compelling. It has great range. I can refill it in almost no time, and it is not impacted by weather,” he added, referring to the issue of electric-car batteries losing range in cold weather.But count Carlos Ghosn unimpressed.Speaking to auto reporters in Tokyo on Wednesday, the 59-year-old Brazilian-born French-Lebanese head of Nissan Motor Co. Ltd. (TYO:7201) and Renault SA (EPA:RNO) pointed out one obvious problem with these plans to roll out HFC cars within two years.""I would be very curious and interested to see competitors who say they are going to mass-market the car in 2015,"" Ghosn said during the opening press days of the 2013 Tokyo Motor Show on Wednesday, according to Bloomberg News. “Where is the infrastructure? Who\'s going to build it?”Tesla’s answer has been to build out its own network of electric quick charge stations. Utilities in places where EVs are popular are beginning to offer EV charging plans similar to mobile phone contracts, and some municipalities are taking the initiative to promote charging networks, especially for public vehicles.Ghosn joins Tesla CEO Elon Musk in poo-pooing the idea of hydrogen fuel cell passenger cars. On a visit to London late last month Musk called HFC cars “bull****,” accusing automakers of exploring HFC as a marketing gimmick.The problem Musk sees is more fundamental than Ghosn’s structural complaint. Ghosn doesn’t see HFC coming as quickly as Toyota and Honda see it, due to the gaping lack of infrastructure. Musk, on the other hand, doesn’t see HFC coming at all, because he insists the fuel is too volatile.“Hydrogen is suitable for the upper stage of rockets, but not for cars,” Musk said at an event promoting his Model S luxury electric sedan late last month.But then, both of these men have placed high bets on EVs.Nissan currently manufactures the Leaf five-door compact, the best-selling passenger EV in history, with a current range of about 80 miles from an 80-kW electric motor. At the L.A. Auto Show on Wednesday, Nissan said it plans to boost U.S. production of the Leaf, which is produced for the local market at Nissan’s publicly supported manufacturing in Smyrna, Tenn., due to robust demand. The Leaf, which debuted in 2010, is still a low-volume seller, but U.S. deliveries spiked 166 percent to 18,078 units from January to October. Nissan sold its 100,000th Leaf this summer. Meanwhile in Europe, Nissan’s sister company Renault is moving forward with a line of EVs ranging from the itty-bitty Twizy to the Fluence Z.E. four-door compact.Betting so much on electrics, Nissan and Tesla both have reasons other than the infrastructural and technological viability of HFC to dismiss efforts by Toyota, Hyundai, Honda and General Motors Co. (NYSE:GM) – which recently joined the U.S. Army in researching the technology – to explore the potential market for HFC.\xa0']"

According to those reports, there should be around 17,000 Model S sedans in U.S. circulation, though the number could be lower depending on how many cars have been delivered abroad since the end of September. It\'s not clear how the NHTSA got to the 13,108 figure. Photo: IBTimes  Unlike other automakers, Tesla neither reports monthly sales figures nor provides highly specific numbers in its quarterly reports. For example, in the company’s third quarter, ending Sept. 30, it said it “finished the quarter with a record of slightly over 5,500 deliveries, including over 1,000 deliveries to European customers.”It’s not clear how the NTHSA came to its highly specific estimate of 13,108 Model S sedans in the U.S. It could be that the figure is drawn from numbers provided by Tesla that have increased. Calls to the NHTSA to answer some questions about Tuesday’s announcement were not returned by the time this story went live.Here’s how many Model S sedans Tesla said in its letters to shareholders it has delivered each quarter since the car entered the market in June 2012.3Q 2013 – “Slightly over 5,500.”2Q 2013 – “5,150 cars were delivered during the quarter.”1Q 2013 – “We recognized 4,900 vehicles as revenue.”4Q 2012 – “…we delivered approximately 2,400 Model S vehicles.”3Q 2012 – “… we … delivered over 250 Model S sedans to our customers.”otal: Approximately 18,200, including “over 1,000” sent to European customers.Recently an unspecified number of cars probably went to fulfill orders in Hong Kong (where last month Tesla said it had about 300 preorders to fill), Japan and Australia.

The company\'s non-standard (non-GAAP) revenue number has been in-line at slightly higher than standard accounting permits, but since the first quarter the two lines have drifted apart thanks largely to the way Tesla is booking future revenue on the sale of post-lease Model S sedans in the future.  Photo: IBTimes based on Tesla balance sheets  Tesla Motors Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is showing a widening gap between generally accepted accounting numbers and its ""adjusted"" figures. The little California electric carmaker with big aspirations could face a federal securities law claim over the way it has been massaging its accounting numbers since its second quarter, but even absent legal challenges, investors should pay closer attention to some of Tesla\'s non-GAAP accounting moving forward.\xa0“We are investigating potential federal securities law claims against officers and directors of Tesla Motors Inc. (Tesla) (NASDAQ:TSLA) in connection with alleged violations by Tesla of Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules governing the disclosure of financial metrics that do not comply with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP),” the New York City law firm Wohl & Fruchter said in a statement Monday.\xa0Securities lawsuits are common when stock prices start to plummet, as TSLA has --\xa0by 31 percent since the Oct. 1 Model S fire\xa0in Kent, Wash., that became a harbinger to two more fires and a disappointing third quarter earnings report. The report itself became the target on Friday of a takedown by Bloomberg View columnist Jonathan Weil, who said the way Tesla reported its 3Q non-GAAP numbers ""seems to fly in the face"" of SEC rules. All of this has been terrible news for a stock that has been riding an equity bubble for months. Since the Nov. 5 earnings report,\xa0two insiders exercised their compensation options\xa0to the tune of more than $12 million worth of TSLA. On Tuesday, Tesla stock was starting at a four-month low of $121.58, but it was still up 32 percent from six months ago as the bubble began to inflate.\xa0    Fox Business News reported Telsa\'s earnings on Nov. 5 by comparing non-GAAP revenue (aka ""adjusted"") of $603 million to the GAAP-based estimate of $524.64 million provided by analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. However, an apples-to-apples comparison would pit the analysts\' estimate with the GAAP revenue, which was lower that the $534 million estimate. Financial reporters often choose to report the ""adjusted"" figures. Tesla\'s GAAP revenue did not beat the estimate, and the market reacted accordingly by butchering the stock on Nov. 5 in after market trading. Photo: IBTimes  Tesla has been reporting two different financial metrics in its earnings reports: the one it\'s required to provide by law, the GAAP, and the adjusted earnings, often used by companies to account for one-time hits to their quarterly balance sheets, such as settling a lawsuit, opening or closing a factory, or paying off a loan early and booking the savings on interest, as Tesla did in its second quarter when it paid off its $465 million Department of Energy loan nine years ahead of schedule. The purpose of non-GAAP, companies say, is to impress on investors that these one-time hits are hiding underlying, organic real value that will be reflected in future quarterly results. Fund investors in particular tend to eschew non-GAAP numbers and focus on the GAAP.\xa0While it’s legal for companies to release their own accounting methodologies, SEC rules require companies to provide GAAP figures and to explain to investors the differences. For insomniacs: here’s a breakdown of the rules for disclosing GAAP and non-GAAP accounting numbers.    Telsa reported its first GAAP and non-GAAP net profit in its first fiscal quarter of 2013. This was the only quarter in the company\'s history that put profit in the black under both accounting measures. But as you can see it improved its profit by adding $14.9 million related to stock-based compensation, a controversial accounting practice.  Photo: IBTimes  As the chart at the top of this story shows, Tesla has been puttering along quarter by quarter deeper and deeper into the red, from 2010, when the company went public, to the end of 2012. The company has been investing heavily in research and development, in building its manufacturing platform, in establishing a complicated supply chain and, most recently, in fleshing out its fast-charger networks and expanding its global sales network. Building a car company from scratch is a capital-intensive venture in ways making a mobile app will never be.But since the company’s second quarter, the GAAP (the green line) and the non-GAAP (the red line) net income have been diverging, with the GAAP showing a loss while the non-GAAP shows a gain. Until 2013, Tesla’s main non-GAAP method of improving its balance sheet every quarter has been to return charges for stock-based compensation into its balance sheet, a controversial accounting method that was invented by the tech industry to lure executives with promises of future stock gains. Companies give them options to buy stock at a set price and executives can buy the stock anytime after it hits a certain level, known as the strike price.\xa0Stephen Jurvetson, a Tesla board member, did this last week, allowing Tesla to book about $1.5 million in ""revenue"" over the $9.53 million Jurvetson made from the deal.    Tesla began adding its non-GAAP lease accounting in the second quarter. Unlike what is truly a one-time item for early repayment of a Department of Energy loan, lease accounting will appear in Tesla\'s earnings reports moving forward. This item assumes Tesla will recover what it thinks it can recover from selling post-lease sedans in a future aftermarket. Critics say the company could be over-estimating what it can get for selling its used luxury cars.  Photo: IBTimes  In the second quarter, Tesla began an even more controversial accounting practice linked to its resale value guarantee for customers who lease its vehicles. What it boils down to is this: Tesla guarantees to buy back leased Model S sedans between 36 and 39 months old for 50 percent of the value of a 60 kWh Model S, and 43 percent of the value of any upgrades. Then it plans to make money from these cars, and reports that money as deferred gross profit. Accountants say tsk-tsk, that you can\'t do that under GAAP.\xa0“As far as I can tell Tesla is accounting for the resale value guarantee assuming that the vehicles will be worth that amount when the guarantee is delivered on,” Ian Gow, assistant professor of business administration at Harvard Business School, wrote in an email to International Business Times. “Given the likely rapid development of electric vehicle technology in the next three years, assuming that three-year-old Teslas will sell for more than comparable BMWs and Lexuses seems ambitious.”\xa0So investors should watch this closely to see how much Tesla books every quarter as money it expects to recover. The answer to the question is this: How much will you pay for a three-year-old Model S later on down the road?\xa0']"

And he stood by the Model S safety record.“Let’s say instead of the Titanic sinking, it smashed through the first iceberg, that second iceberg, and all the passengers disembarked safely and the newspaper headline was ‘Small Kitchen Fire on the Titanic,’” he told the New York Times’ Andrew Ross Sorkin during a DealBook conference in New York City on Tuesday afternoon.WATCH: Elon Musk in action... on his way to build his electric supersonic jet, perhaps? https://t.co/w0uKJuQOtvâ€” marcus baram (@mbaram) November 12, 2013Musk was describing what happened in the Model S accident in Merida, Mexico, on Oct. 16, in which the car smashed into a wall and skidded on its battery pack before colliding with a median. That fire came two weeks after a Model S hit debris on a highway in Kent, Wash., and caught on fire. Last week a similar incident occurred in Smyrna, Tenn. In all cases the drivers walked away from the accidents and the fires were extinguished.Musk is on the defensive following what he said has been “extremely unreasonable” scrutiny of the accidents. He points, like many of his supporters, to the numbers that show 250 to 300 fatalities and up to 1,500 injuries related to car fires that occur regularly with scant, if any, media coverage.“There’s not going to be a recall,” he said, answering rumors that were shuttling around Twitter on Tuesday about a possible recall to bolster the battery pack’s plates. “If there was something that affected safety, we would immediately do a recall.”Here are some other comments Musk made in the first in-depth interview the CEO has granted since the company filed a disappointing third quarter on Nov. 5:ON TELSA’S METERORIC STOCK PRICE RISE“I think the high stock price was somewhat distracting . . . the valuation now is to put a lot of faith in future execution.”ON MEDIA REPORTS OF GEORGE CLOONEY’S NEGATIVE REMARKS ABOUT THE 2008 TESLA ROADSTER“The Clooney comment was a needless comment needlessly reported . . .

(NASDAQ:TSLA) has been in stepped-up damage-control mode since the third Model S fire in six weeks was reported in Smyrna, Tenn., Wednesday. As with the two previous incidents, the company quickly reached out to the car\'s owner, orthopedic surgeon Juris Shibayama, to get his story out.Tesla is hoping to quell any suspicions that its Model S luxury electric sedan poses a greater risk of catching fire than cars with conventional internal-combustion engines. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration maintains that electric vehicles are not more prone to fires than cars powered by internal combustion engines.Following the first reported Model S fire, on Oct. 1 in Kent, Wash., the NHTSA ruled that an in-depth investigation was unwarranted. The second fire took place Oct. 17 in Merida, Yucatan state, Mexico, after a driver who was reportedly drunk hit a wall at high speed and crashed into a median. The video shows a white Model S on fire followed by popping sounds and a flare-up \xa0--\xa0seen between 10 and 20 seconds into the clip. The driver (who was reportedly intoxicated) had exited the vehicle, slightly injured by the impact, and the fire department responders managed to quickly extinguish the blaze using a blast from the fire truck\'s nozzle of a dry powder extinguisher.All three owners, including Shibayama, said they were eager to get Tesla replacements for their burned cars. Nevertheless, this week could see the NHTSA stepping in to investigate, or once again asserting there is no need for further inquiry.Here’s how the doctor describes what happened, which Tesla posted on the company blog on Saturday:""I was driving home from work on the interstate in the right lane at approximately 70 miles per hour, following a truck. In the middle of the lane, there was a rusty three-pronged trailer hitch that was sticking up with the ball up in the air. The truck in front of me cleared the object. I did not have enough time to swerve to avoid the hitch, and it went below my car. I felt a firm \'thud\' as the hitch struck the bottom of the car, and it felt as though it even lifted the car up in the air. My assistant later found a gouge in the tarmac where the item scraped into the road. Somewhat shaken, I continued to drive.""About 30-45 seconds later, there was a warning on the dashboard display saying, \'Car needs service. Car may not restart.\' I continued to drive, hoping to get home. About one minute later, the message on the dashboard display read, \'Please pull over safely. Car is shutting down.\' I was able to fully control the car the entire time and safely pulled off the left shoulder on the side of the road. I got out of the car, and started to get all my belongings out. About 5-10 seconds after getting out of the car, smoke started to come from the front underbody of the car. I walked away from the vehicle to a distance of about 100 yards. More smoke started to come out of the bottom of the car, and about two minutes after I walked away, the front of the car caught on fire.""[Read the full letter here.]The doctor goes on to laud the vehicle\'s advanced warning system. It took about five minutes from the time of the impact with the hitch before the car caught fire.Here’s what Dan Edmunds, director of vehicle testing at the automotive information and pricing provider Edmunds.com, had to say about the incident in a statement issued Thursday:""Is there a problem with the battery pack, the thing everyone is concerned about? We don\'t have enough information to tell. We\'re not yet certain if the pack was involved in the ignition of the third fire at all. But the confined nature of each fire is actually heartening. It tells me that the compartmentalization of the battery pack is preventing the spread of flames back under the cockpit, as designed. The proliferation of flames up front seems to indicate that something else is contributing to the visible flames. It\'s impossible to know how to think about this until we see and analyze pictures of what the drivers struck and where it impacted the underside of the cars in question.""The Model S aced government crash tests earlier this year, and it has won accolades from Consumer Reports as one of the safest vehicles on the road. The car\'s sound structural design and the battery pack itself helps protect drivers from impact injury, and Tesla has pointed out that the cabin was shielded enough from the fires that it allowed the drivers to walk away unscathed.\xa0But with only about 18,000 Model S sedans on the road worldwide by the end of September (about 12,550 through the first half of the year plus the “over 5,500” cited in Tesla\'s third-quarter earnings report last week), it doesn’t take too many such incidents to elicit questions about whether, for example, the undercarriage needs additional protection to prevent punctures from road debris.The Model S is unique in that it’s really the first electric car that performs like a luxury sports sedan that has potential popular appeal. Unlike other more mass-market EVs, like the Nissan Leaf (which, by the way, is manufactured in Smyrna) or the new BMW i3, the Model S invites high-speed driving. And unlike gas-powered vehicles, the volatile material (the contents of the thousands of battery cells that make up the Model S battery pack) is essentially the vehicle’s underbelly – the part of the car most likely to be smacked and hammered by road debris.The answer to these concerns may be, as many of the Tesla loyalists keep saying, that there’s too much scrutiny being placed on Tesla based on three fires. But if there’s nothing serious about three flaming Model S sedans in one month, then any inquiries into these accidents won’t do Tesla any long-term harm. If the cars are safe, they\'re safe and they can withstand the rigors of scrutiny.\xa0Its stock value, on the other hand ... TSLA was already falling after its disappointing earnings report on Tuesday, and the stock fell further after the Tennessee incident. On Friday it was still falling, by 1.3 percent to $137.95, shedding all the gains the stock has made since early August.TSLA last week: Down 15 percent.TSLA past 30 days: Down 21 percent. \xa0TSLA past three months: Down 10 percent.TSLA past six months: Up 147 percent.TSLA year-to-date: Up 307 percent.\xa0']"

Tesla says it chose to use a technology that allows for any new functionality to be easily implemented in the future.The same goes for Tesla\'s 17-inch touchscreen display, which is capable of controlling most of the car\'s functions and features “apps” that a user can choose to customize and display at their discretion. The Tesla 17-inch touchscreen can also open the Model S’ all-glass panoramic roof (the largest of any sedan on the market, Tesla says) and give real-time status of the car’s doors, lights and turn signals.Tesla’s Brenna Boblett, manager of the user interface (UX) found in the Model S, explained to UX Mag this week\xa0that Tesla defines UX as more than just “the feeling that one gets from using a system."" Rather, Tesla defines UX as “the car and the software working harmoniously together to create a unique experience that can be felt even before you sit down in the car.”Tesla’s touchscreen can change regenerative braking settings on the fly, with standard allowing for the Model S to brake more quickly and recharge its battery faster, while a low setting allows for easier coasting and less charge.Tesla’s Chief Technology Officer JB Straubel said this summer\xa0that Linux was chosen as the infotainment center’s operating system because of its open-source standard. The Model S touchscreen controls HD radio and terrestrial radio stations, and AT&T-supplied internet connectivity allows for optional control of satellite like XM and Slacker internet radio, as well as Bluetooth connectivity to stream from a driver\'s smartphone. A tech package equips the Model S with GPS capable of connecting with Google Maps to offer live traffic navigation, along with a full web browser.Boblett says that Tesla Model S also incorporates a feature called Homelink, “where we added a small detail that a traditional garage door opener couldn’t do. When entering your home’s geofence, you are presented with a menu that enables you to open the garage.”Despite being largely driven by the rapid upgrade cycle found in the smartphone industry, Boblett says that Tesla has to account for a much longer product lifestyle compared to an iPhone or Nexus tablet. However, Tesla can update over-the-air (OTA) just like Google and Apple would for a new version of a smartphone’s operating system.“If you think about the term ‘automotive grade,’ what does that mean? Basically it means something needs to work for eight years after you’ve bought the car.” Boblett tells UX Mag. “The UI is no different. If you think about the first thing that becomes outdated in a car, it’s usually the infotainment system.”Boblett said Tesla considered the color reproduction, resolution and touch response rate of the 17-inch haptic touchscreen, much like a smartphone manufacturer would for their next device.\xa0“If the color reproduction is poor or the resolution appears too low, maybe the touch response rate isn’t what you expect, or you have to punch the screen to register a button on the haptic touchscreen, then you know the project has already failed.”In fact, as Engadget reported in October, the Model S and upcoming Model X may soon be able to receive third-party apps by the end of 2014, including Google’s Chrome browser. Musk said in Germany that Tesla is considering adding an Android emulator to take advantage of the UX’s Linux-based platform.']"

Tesla said Tuesday it expects to deliver about 21,500 vehicles this year and is making about 550 units a week, or an annualized rate of 28,600 cars consuming about 200 million battery cells a year.Musk thinks that as the company heads to 2017, it’s going to need more cells than Panasonic, its largest cell supplier, can provide under the current deal. Musk said Tesla’s battery supply issue could eventually require the company to build its own so-called “giga factory” to meet the company’s planned vehicle production by 2017 of three models: the S luxury electric, the X full-sized crossover, and a sub-$40,000 entry-level EV, dubbed the Gen 3 (third generation).Here’s everything Musk had to say on the topic during Tuesday’s conference call: \xa0""I think we will make toward the back end of that a lot more cars, and so there needs to be other agreements with some combination of Panasonic, maybe with others. Panasonic is also our primary partner, but when it comes to the high- volume third-generation vehicle it\'s clear there is going to need to be incremental production capacity. ... There is going to need to be some kind of giga factory built.""But then Musk couches his comment, saying nothing tangible is in the works right now. North American-based production is just one of the options, too.""We are not quite ready to make a big announcement on the cell and battery giga factory, but we are exploring a lot of these options right now, and if I were to guess I think that we would do that giga factory with the raw materials coming in all the way to finished packs with partners ... and that factory most likely would be in North America, but we are investigating other options as well.""The CEO also brushed away any question about the availability of raw materials to meet his and other EV manufacturers\' planned production.""Raw materials are not an issue. ... I wouldn\'t worry about, say, lithium supply. There is a lot of lithium out there and the main constituents really in the cell are, by weight, actually nickel and cobalt, aluminum, then lithium. Lithium is like maybe 1 percent of the cell in that.""']"

(NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk and other top officials of the Palo Alto, Calif., luxury electric carmaker revealed some of the most important details about the progress of the upcoming Model X full-sized luxury crossover SUV during the company\'s third-quarter conference call Tuesday evening.Here’s what Musk said about when consumers can expect the Model X to be en route to their driveways:""I think for the X, we are aiming for maybe a few units at the end of next year, but volume production is -- it\'s a high volume production is probably Q2 2015, so high volume mean volumes comparable to the Model S at that time.""Originally Musk had planned to begin producing the vehicle by the end of this year with deliveries beginning early in 2014. In February that schedule was extended for production to begin by the end of 2014 so that the company could focus on achieving profitability in 2013.Did Musk just extend the production deadline a second time?It depends on what you mean by production. Tesla is stil committed to making its first Model X by the end of 2014, but not to achieve the current level of Modal S sedan production (about 550 a week) until well into 2014.This means most preorders aren’t going to begin in earnest until after the first quarter of 2015.Speaking at an event inaugurating a Tesla retail outlet in London, Musk said the Model X will be priced higher than the Model S, which starts at $71,000 for 205 miles of range, excluding any government incentives to encourage electric vehicle use. Tesla’s stock price fell over 11 percent in premarket trading on Wednesday, to $156.14. The price hasn’t been that low since mid-August amid a dizzying rise in value since May.']"

But shares still tumbled by more than 10 percent in after-hours trading.Excluding items, the company posted earnings of 12 cents per share on revenue of $603 million, compared with a loss of 92 cents a share on revenue of $50 million a year earlier. Wall Street had expected the company to report earnings excluding items of 11 cents a share on revenue of $535 million, according to analysts polled by Reuters.Despite finishing the third-quarter with a record of slightly over 5,500 Model S deliveries, that number still came in below analysts’ expectations.“We are now producing 550 cars per week with improved process controls which consistently result in high quality cars,” said Chairman & CEO Elon Musk in the company’s fiscal third-quarter earnings statement. “Consequently, we finished the quarter with a record of slightly over 5,500 deliveries, including over 1,000 deliveries to European customers. Production in the quarter significantly exceeded deliveries in order to fill the pipeline of vehicles in transit to Europe and provide cars for service and marketing uses.”Meanwhile, the electric-car maker’s fourth-quarter guidance fell short of Wall Street estimates.“We are continuing to expand production and plan to deliver slightly under 6,000 Model S vehicles in Q4, which increases our total expected deliveries to 21,500 vehicles worldwide for 2013,"" Musk added.\xa0On Tuesday, shares of Tesla Motors plunged 12.18 percent to $155.27 in extended-hours trading.Also on Tuesday, Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc.

However, revenue soared 17.6 percent to $7.06 billion, compared with analysts’ expectations of $6.8 billion.“In our first quarter as 21st Century Fox, we delivered strong revenue increases across all of our businesses as well as growth in OIBDA even as we made significant investment in our channels business, and faced a difficult film comparison and currency headwinds,” said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Rupert Murdoch in the company’s fiscal first-quarter earnings statement. “The investment we are making, including the launch of FXX and Fox Sports 1, will drive future sustained growth toward our stated 2016 target of $9 billion of OIBDA and beyond.""In June, 21st Century Fox split from News Corp. into independent, publicly traded companies.

(NASDAQ:TSLA) reported on Tuesday after markets closed that it lost $38.5 million, or 32 cents per share, on $431.4 million in revenue in the third quarter ending Sept. 30. Revenue was up 6 percent from the second quarter.\xa0Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected to see Tesla earning $13.4 million, or 11 cents per share, on $534.64 million in revenue. After one-time charges linked to the company’s massive global expansion, losses of 11 cents per share were expected.""As an automaker with shares trading well above mainstream car companies like GM and Toyota, Tesla’s appeal is based as much on image and reputation as hard financial numbers,"" said\xa0Karl Brauer, senior analyst for automotive information and pricing provider Kelley Blue Book.A bit of good news: Tesla said it boosted its vehicle gross margin to 21 percent from 14 percent in the last quarter. This figure excludes margin-boosting revenue from the sale of its California\'s Zero Emission Vehicle credits to other automakers. Tesla gets seven credits for every vehicle it sells in the state, by far its largest market. Zero Emission Vehicle credit revenue dropped significantly, to $10 million from $51 million in the second quarter. This is good news because it means Tesla is weaning itself off dependence on noncar-related revenue.The company said it’s building 550 cars a week, in line with expectations, as it has delivered “slightly over” 5,500 units, including 1,000 to customers in Europe.\xa0""Our suppliers are also ramping up their capacity to meet our production targets,"" Tesla\'s letter to shareholders said, underscoring one of the bigger challenges for the company: filling back orders.Telsa shares were being hammered in after-market trading.

(Nasdaq:TSLA) has opened its Beijing dealership -- albeit any orders aren’t likely to be filled until well into 2014.Quoting a product specialist on the ground, China Daily reports the Model S in China will cost between $146,000 for the base model and just under $200,000 for the fully optioned Performance Plus model. In the U.S., the price ranges between $71,000 and $120,000; in Europe, it’s between $98,000 and $162,000.In July, Tesla CEO Elon Musk called the Chinese market the “wild card” of the company’s global expansion goals. The Chinese government has been trying to promote electric vehicle use to combat urban pollution and reduce gasoline consumption, but whether there’s a market for EV luxury is far less certain in China, where EVs are generally associated with public transport and taxis.Located in the Parkview Green Mall, in one of Beijing’s ritzier districts, Tesla’s only official Web presence on the mainland still lacks any interface for making reservations or appointments, possibly because Tesla is still securing import and selling licenses. The company had said that would take at least to the end of the year. But, as of Saturday, mall shoppers can at least kick the tires and play with the 17-inch dashboard touch screen in the showroom’s two-display models. \xa0Foreign cars, especially imports, in China typically cost more than they do in other countries, thanks to a bevy of levies, including steep import and sales taxes. Part of the difference in price is what’s being offered in Asia. The base model isn’t an option at Tesla’s Hong Kong dealership, where customers get to choose between the premium Performance and Signature Model S sedans.Customers in China will also have to provide a formidable deposit of about $40,000, the same as what the Hong Kong dealership is requiring for its Signature model, which has a number of added options and color choices. In the U.S., the deposit for any Model S purchase is $2,500; in Europe, it’s about the same, at $2,700.']"

https://www.ibtimes.com/tesla-model-s-sales-norway-down-significantly-october-september-benefitted-pre-order-1453974,Tesla Model S Sales In Norway: Down Significantly In October As September Benefitted From A Pre-Order Bump,Angelo Young,11/04/13,12:06 PM,"['Much ado was made by the auto press early last month when the Tesla Model S electric luxury sedan was the best-selling model in Norway in September. October’s figures are out, and last month’s volume tells a different story with 98 Model S deliveries, or 0.8 percent share of all passenger vehicle sales in the country that month, compared to 616 in September, or 5.1 percent market share for that month.Norwegian sales of the critically acclaimed American-made luxury electric car are being watched closely as Tesla plants its flags across Western Europe to see how well it does in what seems like a bespoke market for Tesla: a country with lots of rich, environmentally conscious consumers who have embraced sustainable development. Tesla’s performance in Norway, as well as other progressive Northern European economies, is vital to its global expansion.    Norway\'s OFV,the association that tracks the country\'s auto sales, said Tesla Model S deliveries for October fell considerably from the previous month.  Photo: IBTimes/Snapshots of OFV data  The big drop in sales volume last month suggests that September, the first month after Tesla began delivering its product in Europe in earnest, was stacked with pre-order fulfillment, representing months of business from early adopters in one of the most electric-car-friendly countries in the world. EV buyers are given generous tax breaks and other perks, such as free parking and ferry service. It also helps Tesla that Norway has one of the world’s highest per capita incomes (it’s ranked fourth by the World Bank), meaning a relatively high percentage of EV buyers with deep pockets.Palo Alto, Calif.-based Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) will present its third-quarter earnings on Tuesday after markets close in New York. Analysts will look for the following: how much Tesla is spending as it ramps up production and deliveries worldwide, the progress on widening its gross margin from auto sales alone, any hiccups in the supply chain and, of course, the number of cars it sold in the quarter. Tesla doesn’t reveal monthly sales data like other auto companies, so real numbers only come out in the earnings reports. \xa0\xa0    Britain\'s Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders doesn\'t track Model S sales numbers. The SMMT did say that there were 430 ""pure electric"" plug in sales in September, but in another report said only 92 vehicles considered ""Other Imports"" were registered in September. Tesla would be in that category since the SMMT doesn\'t track specific model deliveries with such low volume. New auto data will come out of Britain on Thursday.  Photo: IBTimes/SMMT snapshots  Until then, any estimates on the company’s third-quarter sales volume are just that. Norway and Holland auto associations have added the Model S to their monthly sales reports, so we know the company has delivered 1,117 Model S sedans (906 in Norway, 211 in The Netherlands) since the start of the year through October -- most of these delivered in this current quarter. Norway’s October data isn’t out yet, but in September it reported 42 Model S sales so far.    RAI, Holland\'s auto association said 32 Model S sedans were registered in October, or 211 units year-to-date.  Photo: IBTimes/RAI snapshot  Germany doesn’t separate Tesla from general monthly sales data. The country reported 978 EV sales in October. German auto registration data for October isn’t available yet, but we know from earlier official data that at least 98 Model S registrations were on the books in September. Britain, another major European market for Tesla, also doesn’t provide specifics on models that sell low volume. The next auto sales report from the U.K.’s Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders will be out on Wednesday. September data show consumers bought 430 purely electric vehicles in the U.K. but only 92 of all passengers cars bought that month were classified as “Other Imports,” the category that Tesla would fall under. Outside of Europe, Tesla said last month it had more than 300 pre-orders in Hong Kong. Since Tesla only recently went global, we can be relatively certain the total sales volume for the third quarter ended Sept. 30 will easily top 6,000, up from 5,150 units in the second quarter.If volume tops 7,000 in the quarter while maintaining some growth in margins from the sale of the Model S alone (separate from the sale of California Zero Emission Vehicle credits to other automakers, which boosts Tesla’s gross margin), the markets will hail the quarter a success because it would mean the company is in line to more than exceed its guidance of 21,000 unit sales in 2013.Note: The story was corrected to say Germany registered 978 EVs. The original story said this data include hybrids. A reader pointed out that this is incorrect. Germans call EVs ""elektrofahrzeug"" and while in some cases the term ""electric vehicles"" includes both BEVs (battery electric vehicles, such as the Tesla, the Nissan Leaf and the BMW i3) and PHEVs, plug-in electric cars with gas engines, such as the Chevy Volt, the German data of 978 is referring to BEVs, though the tally does not list by specific models.']"

They disappointed.\xa0UPDATE Nov. 5, 1:22 a.m. EST: Tesla's stock gained over $13 on Monday, to $175.20, ahead of Tuesday's third quarter earnings report. The stock price has not been this high since Oct. 21.UPDATE Nov. 4, 4:33 p.m. EST: Here are the October Model S sales numbers from Norway and Holland.\xa0Tesla Motors Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is probably rolling toward its third consecutive quarterly profit, albeit a slim one, as the company engages in a massive, capital-intensive global expansion that has it setting up stores, service centers, charging networks and marketing on both sides of the Atlantic.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters see Tesla earning $13.4 million, or 11 cents per share, on $534.64 million in revenue when it reports its third-quarter, ended Sept. 30, earnings after markets close on Tuesday. However, due to Tesla’s rapid expansion in the third quarter, the company will see significant one-time charges that will bring EPS to a loss of 12 cents per share.Revenue a year ago was only $50.1 million as the company recently accelerated its sales volume to about 5,000 units a quarter and growing. Tesla is in line to meet CEO Elon Musk’s stated goal of topping 21,000 unit sales this year.Gross profit margin is seen edging down to 22.4 percent from 25.1 percent, but this reduction might reflect Tesla’s reduced dependence on the sale of California’s zero-emission vehicle credits to other automakers rather than less profitability from the sale of its cars. If it sells fewer ZEV credits but more cars, gross margin could decline even if the company sees more profit from just auto sales.\xa0“Margins may fluctuate among quarters, but we see improvement overall due to manufacturing cost reductions and more efficiencies from higher Model S production,” said Standard & Poor’s equity analyst Efraim Levy in a research note. “Certain costs should rise as the company expands internationally as it invests in technology and infrastructure for the upcoming Model X SUV. Energy credits, which have better margins than production, should shrink as a proportion of automotive sales and profits.”Charges related to the company’s expansion will continue well into next year as Tesla attempts to become the first successful mass-production auto company built from scratch since Chrysler in 1925. Long story short: the narrative will continue to be about Tesla’s potential future profits rather than its meager ones now. This hope is certainly what has been inflating the company’s equity bubble on the NASADAQ\xa0over the summer and into the fall.\xa0The important factors in the company’s next earnings report will be how many Model S sedans it sold in the third quarter; what the profit margin on those sales were, excluding ZEV credit revenue; and how the company has addressed any issues in its supply chain as it ramps up production. With well over 100 suppliers, Tesla could be confronted with pace-hampering issues at its Fremont, Calif., factory.Musk said in an August conference call that hitting 25 percent profit margin excluding carbon credit sales would be a “significant hill to climb and huge amount of work.” At the time, Tesla’s non-ZEV-credit profit margin was 13 percent; with the credits, 25 percent.As far as unit sales, we should see considerable improvement.As of the first half of the year, Palo Alto-based Tesla has reported delivering about 12,550 units since the Model S debuted in June 2012, most of that volume booked in the first two quarters as the company fulfills pre-orders. Reports from Europe and Hong Kong suggest the possibility of a several hundred additional deliveries outside of the United States (especially thanks to Norway) in previously untapped markets. Because the company has been ramping up production over the summer, we might find a surprise in the sales volume and, if not, some explanation regarding any issues with the supply chain that might be slowing things down.Tesla delivered 4,750 units in the first quarter and 5,150 units in the last quarter, an 8.4 percent rise. At that same pace, U.S. unit sales in the third quarter would top 5,580, excluding deliveries abroad. Including global deliveries and any increase in the rate of U.S. sales, volume will easily top 6,200 for the quarter, making the 21,000 units for 2013 a sure bet.""]"
https://www.ibtimes.com/where-model-s-most-popular-atherton-california-were-15-new-car-registrations-were-1450896,"Where Is The Model S Most Popular? Atherton, California, Were 15% Of New Car Registrations Were Tesla Electric Sedans This Year",Angelo Young,10/31/13,6:24 PM,"['The Tesla Model S is not just the first all-electric vehicle to top 200 miles in range, it’s also a popular toy among America’s West Coast elite.An analysis of new U.S. car registrations from auto data provider Polk by the automotive pricing and information provider Edmunds.com reveals that the Model S is currently the best-selling car in eight of the 25 wealthiest American ZIP codes. Leading the pack is Atherton, Calif., which sits adjacent to the Palo Alto headquarters of Tesla Motors Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) and has a median home price topping $6.6 million.According to the data, 15.4 percent of all new car registrations in Atherton in the first eight months of the year were Teslas, while in nearby Los Altos and Portola Valley they accounted for more than 10 percent.The details shows that high-income Californians are digging the new wheels. For the rest of the country? So far, not so much.\xa0“It’s a classic pattern for any retail product, including cars: the wealthy and influential buyers set a trend, and the mainstream aspires to follow,” says Jessica Caldwell, Edmunds.com senior analyst. “As Tesla increases the number of models and improves its price points, it could find itself in demand by more than just those in these wealthy enclaves. After all, luxury car companies typically find the most volume in their entry-level vehicles.”Tesla has a long way to go for that, even in the low-volume, high-margin luxury car segment. Outside of California, only in Water Mill, N.Y., has the Model S gained market share above 1 percent. The pattern seems to be playing out globally, too, where Norway, a country with a small, affluent population, is where the Model S was the No. 1 selling model in September.Electric cars have never really taken off, historically speaking, and the No. 1 selling EV in history is Nissan’s Leaf, which has found a small niche among customers willing to trade the Leaf’s meager 80 miles of range for zero-emission, lower cost driving. Tesla says it will release a sub-$40,000 EV, possibly called the Model E (the working title is “Gen 3”), in four years.To do that might require the company to sacrifice range, unless it can figure out how to cram more juice into a smaller battery pack that it would probably use for a compact. Until then, it will have to rely on wealthy, environmentally conscious futurists to generate growth.']"

(NYSE:GM) has browsed the online storefront of Telsa Motors Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), where customers can put a $2,500 refundable down payment on a $71,000 Model S sedan with a credit card and a few mouse clicks.Check out what Dan Akerson, CEO of the world’s second largest automakers said during Wednesday’s third quarter earnings conference call, responding to a question from Bank of America analyst John Murphy regarding the company’s efforts to expand its IT operations:“We want people to start buying cars over the Internet. It is a potential half step away from our traditional channels. It doesn’t mean we are going to try and bypass our dealers, but why not in this tech savvy culture we have, this economy we have, for the millennial to come in and say I can shop and I just go down and sign and go. So we are trying to evolve not only from an internal perspective but an external perspective to a more 21st\xa0century information based marketing company.”Dealers, on the other hand, might beg to differ on the idea of General Motors taking something out of Tesla’s rulebook by opening up its own online storefront. Auto retailers in Texas – led basically by two incredibly wealthy merchants – have taken much of the spotlight on the issue, but there are similar laws in almost every state under the auspices of unfair competition, basically they fear manufacturers would put local dealers out of businessGM relies much more heavily on dealers than Telsa (which doesn’t rely on them at all), and Akerson is clearly aware of this, so whatever GM has planned for targeting tech-dependent millennials with an online storefront would have to address dealers’ concerns and state laws. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has managed to strike a balance – selling directly to consumers through its online business and brick-and-mortar outlets while appeasing merchants that sell Apple product by not undercutting them. But cars are not consumer electronics and auto dealers as a unified front is a powerful force to reckon with. \xa0']"

The company said it reached out to the driver, as it did before, which praised the safety and performance of the critically acclaimed luxury electric vehicle.Media reports since the news of the incident went viral after the auto blog Axis of Oversteer serendipitously happened upon a Spanish language news report of the Oct. 17 accident in Mexico's Yucatan. The local newspaper, Progreso Hoy, seemed more fixated on how the car ended up on a median in the city of Merida than it was about the car. The only indication the vehile is a Model S is one photograph; the video of the car popping and then exploding in the first 20 seconds of the clipAs before, the Teslots reacted largely by slamming the media for casting their spotlight on two incidents that would otherwise receive scant attention had they involved vehicles with internal combustion engines. By far the most common complaint involved the number of Tesla car fires compared to the total for conventional passenger cars. These porportionistas argue the Model S is not just as safe as any other sedan but take it a step further to argue they’re less likely to catch fire:For its part, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration concluded in 2011 that electric vehicles in general are not at a greater risk of fire than their gasoline-burning counterparts.In Teslot logic, a car that’s been out for 16 months using new technology, with the biggest pack of lithium ion batteries of any EV on the road, with a high-performance build that invites high-speed driving (as oppose to say, the lower speeds of an electric city car), should be treated exactly the same by the media as when a Honda CR-V flips over on a highway and bursts into flames.But statistically speaking, they’re right.The National Fire Protection Authority says there were 187,500 vehicle fires in the U.S. that killed 270 people in 2011. Its data include only fires that occur on highways and they also include motorcycles, buses, trucks and trailers.The Department of Transportation said there were 41,328,144 light duty vehicles with long wheel bases (full sized passenger cars like the Model S) and 192,513,278 cars with short wheel bases (compacts and smaller) in the U.S. in 2011. Using these numbers, the chances of any vehicle catching fire on a highway in the U.S. is 0.08 percent, or one in 1,250.Telsa doesn’t release sales figures monthly like other automakers. By the end of the first half of the year, prior to Tesla’s global launch, it reported 12,550 unit sales since the car debuted in June 2012. A safe estimate is that there are at least 20,000 Teslas on the road globally, most of them in North America.Two out of 20,000 is 0.01 percent. If these figures are anywhere near accurate, then the Model S is less likely to catch fire than any other vehicle. However, the comparison is specious at best. Comparing a niche luxury sedan with a microcosmic market share of all vehicles to all cars, trucks, buses and motorcycles is probably looking past a lot of nuance. For one thing, the profile of a typical Tesla owner is a member of a wealthy, multi-car household. Secondly, total driving miles for the Model S is miniscule at this point.\xa0There’s a sub-set of the proportionistas who even point to the lack of deaths in both accidents, suggesting the narrative the media should be taking in its coverage is to fawn over the 100 percent survivability rate of two drivers involved in two car fires.Among a minority of the Teslots are the Big Oilers. They’re the fringe minority who believe the auto industry, in bed with the oil industry, has conspired for decades to drive electric vehicles from the marketplace.These are the folks who took to heart “Who Killed the Electric Car?”, the 2006 documentary by Chris Paine that claims corporate conspiracy rather than lackluster consumer interest is the main reason why the world isn’t tooling around in all-electric cars.This view that automakers want Tesla to fail over some partnership they have with Big Oil doesn’t explain away the current raft of electric, plug-in and hybrid cars entering the marketplace, or the billions of dollars in research and development the auto sector has spent and is spending on boosting efficiency and introducing technology that has reduced gas consumption – and car fires, for that matter, which have fallen by well over 50 percent in 20 years.The opposite of the Big Oiler, by the way, is the The Coaler. They’re the breed of Tesla skeptic who point out that the source of most electricity is either coal or natural gas:The Coalers are right, kind of. Most electricity is produced by coal or natural gas. But natural gas – at least in the U.S. – is cleaner and is rising as a source of utility plant fuel. It’s impossible to argue that electric cars are not cleaner, because they do not emit micro-particulate matter, the tiny flecks of soot that causes reparatory problems in densely populated high-traffic areas, or additional greenhouse gases than what are emitted by power plants or, in the case of gasoline, by the refineries.There appears to be great interest in the Telsa and those that feel passionate about the cars it’s making are doing their best to defend the company and the vision of its garrulous CEO Elon Musk. But the next time a Model S catches on fire, it’s a bit of a stretch to expect the media to ignore it.\xa0""]"

The report doesn’t identify the model of the car, but photos posted with the story clearly show a white Model S after firefighters managed to extinguish the flames using dry chemical, a standard for fighting gasoline and electric-car fires.If this had been any other vehicle, the incident would have remained a small, local news item. But a little over two weeks earlier a Model S caught fire in the U.S., in Kent, Wash., raising concerns because the firefighters said they had to cut the vehicle open to access the fire in the battery pack. The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration put an end last week to speculation about safety, saying the incident was not worth a full investigation. The watchdog agency maintains that electric cars are not more likely to catch fire in accidents than conventional cars.Ten seconds into this video, the car’s front end appears to explode.

He also made an ambitious pledge to eventually get his Supercharger network, at least in Europe, to draw more energy from solar power than from power grids, which are mostly fueled by coal or natural gas.Musk also lauded U.S. President Barack Obama for supporting electric cars. Thanks to a federal tax credit, Musk’s Model S is eligible for a price reduction of as much as $7,500 on a luxury car that starts at $71,070 to $91,070 depending on the range or performance and excluding a bevy of enticing add-ons that can put the car into six-figure territory. Telsa also received a $465 million federal loan aimed at promoting EVs, which the company said in May it paid off nine years early and then reported the $16.3 million in interest saved as income in its second quarter 2013 report. Nissan North America and Ford Motor Co.\xa0 have also received billions of dollars in loans, in Nissan’s case to build a lithium-ion battery facility in Smyrna, Tenn.Tesla will report the results of its third quarter on Nov. 5.\xa0Musk also took a swipe at other plug-in vehicles on the market. This is what he said about the Nissan Leaf, the best-selling fully electric vehicle in history that’s in line to deliver its 100,000th unit by January if it can maintain the pace of around 4,700 units it sold in September, and the Chevy Volt, the plug-in electric vehicle from General Motors Co. (NYSE:GM), the world’s second-largest automaker:“What Nissan’s doing with the Leaf is sincere. I think Nissan ought to be applauded for its efforts, and GM also for the Volt. That’s not saying those are great products, they’re not great products, but just because the products are not great doesn’t mean they shouldn’t be applauded for those efforts, because they just need to iterate and iterate to make a better electric car. It’s a step in the right direction, and they need to keep going in that direction.”This is what Musk said about the i3, the recently released all-electric city car from Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (FRA:BMW), the world’s largest luxury carmaker that recently said it has about 8,000 preorders for the $41,350 EV that has a range of about 90 miles.“My initial impression of the i3 is it looks a bit funny and the range is not high enough. It seems to have been made intentionally weird, as opposed to letting the form follow function.

Tesla Motors Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk reacted quickly to tamp down concerns about any unusual fire hazard from the lithium-ion battery packs that power the company\'s $71,000 sports car. The Tesla zealots chimed in almost instantly in defense of the product on Twitter, online forums and in the peanut gallery of online comment threads.But now it’s official: The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration says the incident isn’t worth investigating. We would have known sooner, but since the Oct. 16 end of the partial government shutdown that put a halt to most of its operations, the agency has been working to get back on the road. Now it’s back, and on Thursday the agency put an end to any lingering speculation.This is the NHTSA’s statement regarding the fire:“After reviewing all available data, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has not found evidence at this time that would indicate the recent battery fire involving a Tesla Model S was the result of a vehicle safety defect or noncompliance with federal safety standards.\xa0The agency continually reviews incoming and prior consumer vehicle complaints, as well as other data to identify potential vehicle defect trends and takes appropriate action as necessary.""    Tesla\'s first quarterly profit came with help from the sale of $68 million worth of zero-emission carbon credits in the state of California.  Photo: IBTimes  This piece of welcome news came on the same day California’s Air Resources Board ruled that it would delay modifying rules that would have reduced Tesla’s share of zero-emission vehicle credits. Because Tesla makes only electric cars, it gets a bountiful share of these credits, which it can sell to other automakers who market carbon-emitting vehicles in the state of California. The rule grants Tesla more credits for its quick-swap battery technology to promote innovation that speeds up electric-vehicle charging times, which would attract more consumer interest. The crux of the matter is that the battery-swap technology has yet to be fully implemented, but Tesla’s commitment to speeding up an electric vehicle’s recharging has been enough for it to generate more revenue from selling its carbon offsets.Tesla sold $68 million worth of these credits in the first quarter, or 12 percent of its revenue, when the company reported a $30.5 million loss. It sold $51 million worth of carbon offsets in the second quarter, which helped it report its first quarterly profit of $11.2 million.The two bits of good news came a day after Bank of America said the company’s stock was vastly overvalued and 12 days ahead of the company’s third-quarter earnings announcement.\xa0']"

There are people who pore over every statement Musk issues as if it were a papal encyclical. There’s even a website that collects his nuggets of wisdom and a Twitter feed that makes fun of them.That Musk is doing amazing things at great personal financial investment only makes him giant in the minds of those who admire people who put their money where their mouths are. Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos, who also made the list, is another entrepreneur known for maintaining significant financial exposure to his business rather than relying solely on the equity markets to capitalize it.

On Wednesday Bank of America reiterated its view that shares in Tesla Motors Inc. (NYSE:TSLA) are “vastly overvalued from a fundamental standpoint” and issued a bearish, or more like grizzly bearish, 12-month price target of $45 for a stock that hit its 52-week summit of $194.50 just over three weeks ago.Here’s what BoA analyst John Lovallo said in a report that shaved over $7 off a share of TSLA by close of market in New York on Wednesday, to $164.50.“We have also expressed concern that retail investors could ultimately be at risk, as institutional ownership of Tesla shares continues to wane. ... Thus far we have largely been howling at the moon, but believe it is worth considering what could occur when sentiment behind a momentum-driven stock shifts. This appears to be slowly occurring, driven by factors such as the recent Model S battery fire and potential NHTSA probe, and speculation of a slowdown in the company's European expansion. In fact, Tesla shares are down roughly 12 percent from their Sept. 30 closing price of just over $193 a share. While the recent decline pales in comparison to the year-to-date hyperbolic growth of the shares, it could foreshadow emerging cracks in the seemingly ironclad façade surrounding Tesla's stock.”The note refers to the annoucement on Tuesday in Washington by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration that it would investigate the Oct. 1 Tesla Model S fire south of Seattle after the agency reopened. The government shutdown temporarily halted NHTSA and other regulatory government activity.\xa0Bank of America has issued its most cautionary note since the start of Tesla's surge in May. Since then, institutional investors have been scaling back their exposure. Meanwhile, the Teslots (Tesla zealots) have been hyping and pumping the stock, luring average Joes and Janes – without access to sound investment advice – to buy shares. While some have walked away folding lettuce into their wallets on this quickly inflating equity bubble, there will be a lot of losers in short-term stock gambling.Tesla will report its third-quarter earnings on Nov. 5. Look for the company’s sales volume numbers, any information about its progress in Europe, and pay more attention to the GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) than to the non-GAAP: Tesla reports both of those. In its second quarter, the non-GAAP measure reported profit but the GAAP measure was in the red because it excluded carbon credit sales revenue and didn't treat the interest saved by paying a government loan back nine years early as income.\xa0""]"

Even a disappointing jobs report did little to temper rising equities, likely because investors are starting to associate lackluster indicators with more QE action from the Federal Reserve.So doesn\'t a stock rally mean good things for the economy? Not this one, said Nicholas Colas, chief market strategist at ConvergEx Group, a global brokerage company based in New York, in a note to investors.“You could easily call the current market move the ‘tree falling in the forest rally’,” he said. “‘Real’ rallies have the compelling impetus of social attention. This isn’t that kind of rally, and I can prove it.”Colas looked at Google Trends data for the search terms ""investing,"" ""stock quotes"" and ""food stamps,"" and here’s what he found:From the note:The peak volume of Google searches for “investing” and “stock quotes” in the U.S. from 2005 to the present was back in October 2008, during the depths of the financial crisis. People wanted to know what their assets were worth – not because they were rising in value, but because they were plummeting. Since then, the number of Google searches for those terms has been cut in half or more. Yes, equity asset prices have more than doubled, but interest in tracking that progress is diminishing daily. In contrast to financial markets, interest in the search term “food stamps” is up over 50 percent since October 2008, even excluding the jump from the recent system outage.Colas looked at some additional Google Search terms for clues to the state of the economy, and here’s what he found:“Bernanke” vs. “Greenspan” vs. “Kardashian”\n\n“The recent publication of former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan’s latest book has given him a boost in terms of Google searches, but current chair Ben Bernanke has maintained a comfortable lead since 2009. If you want to touch the hem of real fame, consider the comparison of Chairman Bernanke to the Kardashian clan. Google Trends shows that the reality-TV clan outscores the Fed chair by anywhere from 30 to 100 to one.”“Janet Yellen” vs. “Amy Winehouse”\n\n“Janet Yellen managed to beat [deceased singer] Amy in terms of search volume on October 7-8-9th, the days around the announcement that she was President Obama’s choice for the next Chair position at the Federal Reserve. Since then, it has been back to the old pattern: Amy Winehouse searches outnumber Janet Yellen queries by a factor of 7:1. Don’t worry, Janet – tears dry on their own.”“Buy a House” vs. “Rent a House” vs. “Rent an Apartment”\n\n“Don’t believe all the hype about how Americans don’t want to own their primary residence anymore. The Google data kills that meme. Searches for “rent a house” are essentially flat over the last three years. “Rent an apartment” is looking better, but little growth there for the last 2 years.”“TMZ” vs. “WSJ” and “Wall Street Journal”\n\n“You’d think the prospect of reading about how to improve your finances and live a more independent life would trump Kanye/Kim, the Jacksons, and random pictures of celebrities behaving badly. You’d be so, so wrong. Crazy wrong. TMZ’s score for October 2013 was 61. WSJ and Wall Street Journal\'s search scores: 11 and 15.”“ETF” vs. “Mutual Fund” vs. “Hedge Fund”\n\n“Another example of the odd inversion between higher markets and lower social engagement in markets: October 2008 was high-water mark for Google searches for the terms ‘ETF’ and \'mutual fund’ and ‘hedge fund’ over the last five years. It has been all downhill since then, even as stock markets have continued to climb.”“Searches for ‘mutual fund’ have been in persistent decline since 2005. The high point by Google’s measure was an index measure of 100 in January 2005. Now, that number is 19.“‘Hedge fund’ as a search term doesn’t fare much better, with peaks around the financial crisis in terms of searches and down ever since.”“‘ETF’ is the most popular of the three, with roughly double the number of Google searches relative to the other two.”“TSLA” vs. “GOOG” vs. “AAPL”\n\n“When a company has a stock symbol distinct from its corporate name (i.e., TSLA rather than GM), using Google Trends to track that ticker is a useful way to measure social engagement. More people punching ‘AAPL’ into Google is one sign that they have an interest in Apple’s stock rather than reading about the latest iPad.”“Looking at the Google Trends charts for ‘TSLA’, ‘GOOG’ and ‘AAPL’ is therefore a proxy for retail investor interest in these names. Don’t take that as a buy/sell signal, of course – institutional investors are way more than half the stock market.

(NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk took a swipe at efforts by rival automakers to develop hydrogen fuel technology – which would power vehicles using cells that produce electricity derived from a chemical reaction between hydrogen and oxygen.“Oh God, fuel cell is so bull****,” Musk told a crowd of German Tesla fans in Munich, pointing to hydrogen’s volatility. “Hydrogen is suitable for the upper stage of rockets, but not for cars.”Musk scorned automakers that are developing the technology, calling into question the sincerity of their stated goals and suggesting they are engaged in hydrogen research and development just for marketing purposes. And for sure questions need to be answered about the viability of a car powered from an onboard pressurized tank of hydrogen gas.\xa0In recent years major automakers including Volkswagen AG (FRA:VOW3) , Daimler AG (FRA:DAI), Ford Motor Co. (NYSE:F) and Honda Motor Co. (TYO:7207) have all devoted significant resources to what Musk (perhaps cheekily) called a marketing ploy. If so, it's a costly one.\xa0In 2008, Honda rolled out its FCX Clarity – a six-figure Civic-based hydrogen fuel cell vehicle – basically as a test run for a possible full rollout in 2018. Toyota recently upped the timeline ante by announcing it would roll out a hydrogen-powered Prius. If these cars are as dangerous as Musk claims, we’ll know soon enough if hydrogen is a dead end toward truly zero-emission vehicles.Musk’s visit to Germany was mainly to promote the Model S electric sedan, whose sales in Europe’s largest economy have so far been dwarfed by those in the Netherlands and Norway. He outlined the progress in building Tesla’s Supercharger network in the country – the first six stations are currently in construction and at least 34 more stations are in the planning stages. By the end of next year, Musk says 80 percent of the German population will be within 62 miles of a Tesla Supercharger station. Of course, Musk’s biggest challenge will be to convince Germans to buy American cars.But the appeal of the Tesla event in Germany was as much about Musk as it was about his critically acclaimed car.\xa0And he didn’t disappoint. He even tossed in a profanity for extra measure.Note: the video of Musk's Munich appearance is below, following what appears to be an odd 15-minute German-language spiel. You can fast forward to the Tesla event by clicking the timeline bar in the video below to around the fifteen-minute mark.""]"

Tesla's stock fell more than 3 percent in morning trading in New York in what could be the start of a market correction ahead of the company's quarterly earnings report, which is due out in two weeks.\xa0Germany, whose auto market is larger than the other three countries combined, is considered one of the more environmentally progressive countries in Europe. But in August and September, buyers there registered only 98 Model S cars, according to the country’s Federal\xa0Motor\xa0Transport Authority, known by its acronym, KBA.“The American electric car maker Tesla's global expansion in Germany is making comparatively slow progress,” said the German-language Manager magazine in a report on Monday.The electric car market is growing but still small in Europe as it is everywhere else. But unlike in Norway where the Tesla Model S was the best selling of any model last month\xa0beating out the gas-burning Volkswagen Golf, in Germany three other electric vehicles outsold the Tesla in September: the Smart EV by Daimler AG (146 units), the Renault Zoe (57 units) and the Nissan Leaf (55 vehicles). The Leaf is the No. 1 global EV on the market, having sold more than any EV in history.Meanwhile, according to the automotive and bicycle authority of The Netherlands, known as Rai Vereniging, Tesla logged 348 Model S registrations in August and September, making it the second-strongest market in Northern Europe. Tesla set up an assembly plant in Tilburg, Holland, earlier this year, where it also houses its European headquarters. Meanwhile, in Denmark, with a population a little larger than Norway's, there were 85 Tesla Model S registrations, according to its auto authority.Most certainly Tesla -- which boasts the longest range of any EV in history and is seeking a market different from the one that buys electric minis -- is working to fill back orders and is looking to expand showroom and staff in Europe. But this data suggest that early Tesla sales performance in Norway, with its small and moneyed population of 5 million people, is not going to extend to other environmentally progressive European countries.Germany has reacted coolly to the Model S so far, and that doesn’t bode well for the car maker out of the gate, but it’s still too early to write off Tesla’s European expansion, as the auto market in Europe has been reeling. September saw a modest 2.5 percent rise in vehicle sales in Europe, the biggest jump in more than two years.Norway has some of the most enticing incentives for buying electric cars -- including free parking, free ferry transit and tax incentives that price the Model S lower than comparable gas-burning luxury sedans -- so it made sense for Tesla to target the country heavily early in its global expansion.Tesla will report its third quarter earnings on Nov. 5. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect $13 million in profit, or 11 cents per share, on $535 million of revenue.\xa0""]"

It’s really just a car-shaped sub, but one that fills up with water when submerged.“I was disappointed to learn that it can’t actually transform,” Musk told CNN Money. “What I’m going to do is upgrade it with a Tesla electric powertrain and try to make it transform for real.”The car was discovered in a neglected Long Island storage locker that was purchased for less than $100. The new owner eventually had the vehicle authenticated by the Ian Fleming Foundation as not only being one of the models used in the film, but the only model that was actually capable of submerging.This won’t be the first time Musk has worked off of a Lotus design.

(NASDAQ:TSLA) from ""outperform"" to ""neutral,"" another firm went the opposite direction Tuesday, upgrading the company’s stock from neutral to outperform.Investors embraced the bullishness (big surprise) over the year’s most-hyped stock, adding more than $5 to the price of a share that was trading at under $100 in June and is now around $185. The recent upgrade is based on perceived consumer optimism for a lower-cost Tesla car that isn’t due out until 2017. But while small-time investors are piling in, mutual funds – ever the cautious stock market players – have been reducing their exposure to TSLA volatility.TSLA has more than bounced back from that embarrassing Oct. 8 Model S fire incident south of Seattle, helped along significantly by the investment upgrade on Tuesday by Los Angeles-based investment firm Wedbush Securities, which offered the highest target price so far: $240 a share. Wedbush analysts Craig Irwin and Min Xu\xa0backed their assertion with their survey of nearly 900 people and concluded there would be mass-market appeal for a Tesla model priced around $40,000.The Palo Alto, Calif.-based maker of the critically acclaimed Model S luxury sedan says it will release a vehicle in that price range – presumably with a Model S-like electric vehicle driving range above 200 miles – that’s been dubbed the “Gen III” and which could end up being called the Model E or the Model Y. (Tesla now owns the trademark to the following four model letters: S E X and Y. Get it?) Investors shook off last week’s investment downgrade from Milwaukee-based asset manager R.W. Baird to neutral from outperform.Mutual funds, including six of the top 10 largest fund investors in Telsa, have collectively lowered their stakes in the company from a cumulative 53 percent to 38 percent at the end of September, according to Thomson Reuters.Mutual funds – at least ones with whom you would want to trust your money -- often begin repositioning when a company’s stock is entering periods of volatility, selling on the upward trend. Then retail investors – pumped up on media and analysts\' hype — continue to drive the stock up further until (as has been seen many times in the history of market economics) reality sets in, leaving latecomers holding the bag as the stock returns to some semblance of rational pricing.    The smart money buys early. Institutional investors, espeically mutual funds, tends to begin shifting positions as the stock rises. But individual retail investors often join the rally later than they should, pumped up with media hype and analysts notes.

The company had aimed to sell at least 10,000 i3s next year in an increasingly crowded market for EV minis.All-electric cars have popped in and out of automotive history going all the way back to the beginning. They fell back into vogue in the early 70s during U.S. gasoline shortages amid the Arab oil embargo against the US. But the cars failed the range test (they were basically glorified golf carts) and never caught on. Now, innovations in battery technology have delivered a recent revival of EV interest. Certainly more passenger-car EVs have been sold in recent years than have ever been sold, and so it’s possible that after a century of starts and stops, EVs might finally carve out a niche for themselves—especially for urban, commercial and public transportation needs.So how many EVs have been sold worldwide in this recent resurgence of interest?Nissan Motor Co. Ltd. (TYO:7201) has really taken the lead with its 80-mile range Leaf five-door compact, which debuted in December 2010 and sold its 100,000th unit in July. The Leaf is by far the leader in the EV market, which excludes plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) like the Chevy Volt, which is assisted by an internal combustion engine.Renault SA (EPA:RNO), France’s second-largest automaker, which owns 43 percent of Nissan, has sold about 40,000 of its line of four EVs since they started hitting the market in 2011, led by the Zoe five-door mini and the Kangoo van, more than half of those delivered between January and August of this year.There is also a smattering of recent, very-low-volume sellers, such as the Smart fortwo EV, the Volvo C30 DRIVe and the Ford Focus Electric. Their sales numbers are currently negligible and may never take off the way Nissan’s Leaf has.And of course there’s the Model S from Tesla Motors Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), maker of the first EV to break 200 miles of range. The company has confirmed sales of 12,550 units as of the first half of the year. As reported earlier, there may be as many as\xa013,000 more Model S sedans that have been assigned vehicle identification numbers, so it’s easy to assume the company will exceed its goal of selling at least 21,000 units this year. Many analysts are estimating that the company will announce between 5,000 and 6,000 units sold in the third quarter when sales figures come out in the first week of November.China automakers have their own raft of electric vehicles coming out as the country attempts to reduce vehicular emissions in its larger cities. (The BYD e6 is being used as electric taxis, for example.) Chinese-made EV sales figures are currently difficult to calculate, partly because they’re so new and largely because Chinese consumers avoid buying Chinese made cars in general if they can afford to.Excluding China’s domestic market for locally designed and produced EVs, and including BMW’s 8,000 pre-orders, the total global worldwide tally of passenger car EVs sold since December 2010’s Nissan Leaf debuted is approaching 170,000 units, and probably exceeding that figure if you include the low-volume sellers. That comes out to roughly 56,000 vehicles a year. \xa0This may not be much – global passenger car sales topped 80 million last year and a typical best selling passenger car like a Honda Civic or a Ford F-Series pickup truck routinely exceed total EV annual sales in just a few months – but considering historical sales volumes of all-electric cars (few EVs made before the 2000s ever sold more than a couple of thousand units before being discontinued) the current numbers are high enough to qualify this renewed interest and innovation in EVs to be somewhat of a renaissance.Correction: An original version of this story said Renault was the largest automaker in France.

As of Thursday the data suggest there are at least 25,822 Model S VINs, excluding European identification numbers assigned to cars being produced in Telsa's Holland factory. Tesla has said it has sold 12,550 Model S sedans between June 2012, when the car debuted, to June of this year. This leaves 13,272 units that, according to this customer-provided data, have been assigned VINs. Tesla will annouce its third quarter sales figures in the first week of November.\xa0Original story begins here:One of the most important items in Tesla Motors’ third quarter earnings due out the week of Nov. 4 will be how many cars it delivered to customers between July and September. There are strong indications from the online community of Teslots -- the Tesla zealots who follow and analyze every development regarding the maker of the Model S luxury electric sedan -- that the company is well on its way to significantly higher sales growth quarter-to-quarterAny speculation as to the exact number of deliveries by Tesla Motors Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is just that, speculation. If the company itself were to give any indication of auto sales, it would have to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission to do so. Tesla itself says it has delivered 12,550 Model S sedans from the model's debut in June 2012 to June of this year.But there is news out there that suggests at the very least that the company will amply exceed the 5,150 vehicles it delivered in the second quarter and shatter the goal of selling more than 20,000 units this year.That number could be closer to 40,000 by the end of the year if VIN information trickling out from the Teslot community is accurate. The VIN, or vehicle identification number, identifies individual automobiles. Like other car companies, Tesla’s VIN includes a sequential serial number at the end. Since the Model S is so new to the market, the serial number can be used to track the number of vehicles the company is making, had made or has sold.Customers are given VINs after they make an order, and it takes months for the car to be delivered, so while the number doesn’t necessarily indicate how many cars have been sold, it does tell you how many cars are in the works.So what do we know?Last month Deutsche Bank cited VIN numbers indicating the company was in line to be meeting a demand at an annualized rate of 30,000 vehicles in this quarter. Tesla began selling cars in Europe and Asia in the third quarter and those sales will definitely help Tesla meet or break analysts production estimates. In Norway, for example, the company sold 616 units in September, making the Model S the No. 1 selling model in that electric-vehicle-friendly country.But consider the data being compiled quite regularly by a contributor to the company’s Forum page identified as Craig Froehle, someone who has asked Tesla owners to provide their VINs for either cars that have been delivered to them or ones that are in the production process, meaning they could be delivered months from now.As of Tuesday, the VIN sequence tracked with the help of Tesla customers has reached 25730, meaning 25,730 units since Tesla began production. If you subtract the 12,550 units delivered since the end of the second quarter, the remaining number is 13,180.\xa0Of course, these numbers include cars currently being produced for delivery in the coming months, including back stock to reduce delivery time and showroom display models. But even if only half of these cars were actually sold in the third quarter, it would still be a significant 27 percent increase from the sales in the second quarter, more than enough to satisfy the expectations by analysts and to cause the Teslots to swoon.Tesla has yet to announce the date of its quarterly earnings report that will confirm these numbers, but the Nasdaq exchange says the announcement will be made in the first week of November.Correction: As readers have pointed out, the VIN would be the same on both sides of the Atlantic, and the Tilburg Tesla facility is only an assembly plant, so there wouldn't be additional VINs across the pond. Your reporter humbly bows to the knowledge of these fine readers, from whom he has learned a lot. I've made the corrections above thanks to the feedback below.""]"

It\'s down 12.55 percent since Oct. 3, the day after the Model S fire incident south of Seattle despite recovering its loss on Monday. Is this a correction, jitters over the looming issues over government debt and the ongoing shutdown, or both?\xa0Original story begins here:\xa0Telsa Motors Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock was down Wednesday with no tangible reason to point to, such as an investment downgrade or another eye-catching accident, like the one last week that appeared to promulgate a much-anticipated correction in the overvalued stock.It may be just that: a correction leashed to an overall downturn in the markets as Congressional members continue to hold the U.S. economy hostage to political wrangling days ahead of a deadline on the debt ceiling.Tesla’s stock was down nearly 14 percent on Wednesday afternoon since its start of trading on Oct. 2, a day after a Tesla Model S struck debris on a highway south of Seattle and caught fire, leading to no injuries. What would have been a routine roadside car-fire incident had it been any other (nonelectric) vehicle was big news because EV batteries are becoming powerful enough to raise concerns over lithium-ion battery chemical fire risk.The news of the accident, and the fact firemen said the fire re-ignited and got worse when water was applied, led CEO Elon Musk to insist the fire would have been worse in a conventional gasoline-burning vehicle. For his part, the owner of the vehicle said he had no concerns about the safety of Model S sedan. \xa0Speaking at a symposium at Stanford University on Tuesday, J.B. Straubel, Tesla’s 37-year-old chief technical officer and the brains behind the Model S’s software and electronics, said Tesla’s battery is surrounded by firewall protection that prevents battery fires from penetrating the cabin.""The vehicle performed great,"" Straubel said of last week\'s accident.\xa0 “The driver of the vehicle was hugely appreciative.""Nevertheless, the fire incident does appear to have been the tipping point for a TSLA stock-price correction. Despite gaining back the loss since the accident by Monday, since the start of the week TSLA’s price has retreated to below $170 a share, a price it hasn’t seen since mid September. The last bearish analysts’ reports occurred before and on the same day of the crash, when Zacks Investment Research and R.W. Baird both downgraded the stock. Since then, no substantial news would point to the downturn the stock has seen since Monday.If anything, the latest news would have normally boosted demand for Tesla’s stock. The company announced this week it’s offering the option of CHAdeMO DC quick charger compatibility, which expands the number of charging stations that a Tesla vehicle owner can use. As reported earlier in IBTimes, the Model S is the top-selling model in electric-vehicle-friendly Norway, and now Reuters reports that customers there are buying second-hand Teslas as a premium because of the waiting list. Also, MPG Car Rental – a Venice Beach, Calif.-based company – has become the second car rental agency after Hertz Corporation to offer the Model S.With TSLA’s current volatility, we could see a complete rebound by the end of the week based on these developments. At the same time, it would be difficult to imagine the price maintaining the trajectory of the past six months that has seen it rise more than\xa0300 percent. If you got in on the ground floor of this stock rise, you’re in a sweet spot. But institutional investors have been scaling down their ownership on the stock, indicating that retail investors are going to end up – as they often do– holding the bag on the correction.Tesla has not announced the date of its third-quarter results release, but it’s expected in the week of Nov. 4, according to Thomson Reuters.']"

(NASDAQ:TSLA) chairman, CEO and co-founder Elon Musk defended the safety of the electric cars made by his company in a blog post, while revealing what was apparently responsible for a recently publicized Model S sedan fire.According to Musk, a large, curved piece of metal that had fallen off a semi-trailer punctured the armor plate underneath the Model S, piercing the vehicle’s battery. “The geometry of the object caused a powerful lever action as it went under the car, punching upward and impaling the Model S with a peak force on the order of 25 tons,” Musk said in the blog post.The Model S owner did not suffer any injuries, and the fire that broke out in the front battery module was contained by the electric vehicle’s built-in safety features, including internal firewalls and vents, Musk said. Firefighters punctured the top of the Model S lithium-ion battery, which led to the fire spreading before it was put out by a combination of water and dry chemical extinguisher.Despite the fire, Musk claimed it is safer to power an automobile with a battery than with a\xa0 tank of flammable liquid. “A typical gasoline car only has a thin metal sheet protecting the underbody, leaving it vulnerable to destruction of the fuel supply lines or fuel tank, which causes a pool of gasoline to form and often burn the entire car to the ground,” Musk said. Tesla’s CEO also provided some figures to back his claim, saying there is the equivalent of one vehicle fire for every 20 million miles driven in conventional vehicles, compared with one vehicle fire for every 100 million miles driven in Tesla vehicles.The owner of the vehicle, identified as Robert Carlson, said in an email to Jerome Guillen, director of Tesla’s Model S Programs, that he remained a firm believer in the company and its vehicles. Carlson said in the email, reprinted with permission on the Tesla blog: “I guess you can test for everything, but some other celestial bullet comes along and challenges your design. I agree that the car performed very well under such an extreme test. The batteries went through a controlled burn which the internet images really exaggerates.”After the news, and video, of the Model S fire surfaced, Tesla’s share price took a big hit. According to reports, Musk’s personal worth also took a hit, around $594 million, because of the falling share price.']"

Co-founder and CEO Elon Musk, who owns about 23 percent of the company, is a little less of a billionaire on Friday since the value of his stake has shrunk by about $594 million.Meanwhile, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. issued a research note that appears to have been written before news of exactly what the firefighters of the Regional Fire Authority of Kent, Wash., 20 miles south of downtown Seattle, confronted. “The fire dep’t was called, arrived at the scene and extinguished the fire without further incident,” wrote Deutsche Bank analyst Dan Galves in a note that rates TSLA a buy.As Deutche Bank pointed out, the Model S has driven 83 million miles and has had only a dozen significant accidents; this is the first fire in a Tesla vehicle. But how the fire team extinguished the fire on Tuesday should not be considered “without further incident.”“The fire appeared to be extinguished, then reignited underneath the vehicle,” said the incident report. After they sprayed the car with water, the situation got worse. “The application of water seemed to intensify the fire activity.”Responders then applied dry chemical flame retardant, which “put down the majority of the fire.” But in order to fully extinguish the flames, responders had to use a circular saw to “cut an access hole into [the] front structural member to water the battery pack.”The incident underscores an important question about electric vehicles in general – and especially electric luxury vehicles that are more likely than smaller, dinkier EVs to be speeding down highways: How should firefighters respond to EV fires? What happens if there isn’t a driver alive to inform them that the car is electric? Do firefighters need to be aware of EV models so they know automatically to apply dry chemical flame retardant? Will they need to cut EVs open to fully extinguish the flames?There are all significant questions. Hopefully the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration, currently shut down due to congressional incompetence, will open up again soon to look into the matter.\xa0']"

Despite Deutsche Bank saying the fire was extinguished ""without further incident,""\xa0Questions remain about how firefighters should confront electric-vechile battery fires.\xa0UPDATE: Oct. 2, 2013, 7:40 p.m. EDT:Here are more details from the Regional Fire Authority of Kent, Washington about the incident inovoling a Tesla Model S electric sedan catching fire after hitting an object near Seattle. Firefighters said water intensified the fire.Original story begins here:A car engulfed in flames near a highway exit isn’t news. That the car in question was a Tesla Model S luxury electric sedan is, because the lithium ion batteries used to power cars and other objects have been known to smoke and catch fire under certain conditions.According to the Regional Fire Authority of Kent, Wash., 20 miles south of downtown Seattle, the driver of a black Model S struck something on the HOV lane of Highway 167 Tuesday morning, then managed to exit before the vehicle erupted into flames.There were no injuries, but video footage caught by a passerby and uploaded onto YouTube show the front end of the car on fire.\xa0The report says the vehicle began smoking and then caught fire as it was exiting the highway. But the report is inconclusive as to what caused the flames.On Wednesday, Tesla made a statement about the incident:\xa0“A Model S collided with a large metallic object in the middle of the road, causing significant damage to the vehicle. The car’s alert system signaled a problem and instructed the driver to pull over safely, which he did. ... A fire caused by the substantial damage sustained during the collision was contained to the front of the vehicle thanks to the design and construction of the vehicle and battery pack.”The issue is a touchy one as Tesla works to become the first since Chrysler in 1925 to build a successful car company from scratch. Lithium-ion batteries have been the subject of scrutiny over the years for their potential to overheat and catch fire.“Overheating and collisions may cause [lithium ion car] batteries to short-circuit and burst into flames,” said a report by Jennifer Chu of MIT News in June on how engineers are working to lower these risks.Extensive testing of the Model S by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration recently earned the car top safety marks in crash tests. Neither the NHTSA nor Tesla has reported any spontaneous battery combustions, but the issue of overheating, smoking and fire in collisions are as real as they are for conventional gasoline-burning cars.The Chevy Volt went onto the fire-risk spotlight in 2011 when a series of NHTSA crash tests showed the possibility of batteries overheating and catching fire, in some cases weeks after an accident. But to allay public concerns, the agency released this statement in November 2011: ""NHTSA is not aware of any roadway crashes that have resulted in battery-related fires in Chevy Volts or other vehicles powered by lithium-ion batteries.”Electric-vehicle promoters claim critics are exaggerating the risk of batteries overheating, and they point to the volatility of pure lithium, which can catch fire if it comes in contact with water.\xa0But the NHTSA has stated that lithium ion batteries do not pose a greater fire risk than gasoline-powered vehicles.Or, to put it another way, an electric car is not immune to accident-related flame-outs.']"
https://www.ibtimes.com/tesla-delivered-616-units-ev-friendly-norway-besting-previous-no-1-vehicle-vw-golf-1413752,"Tesla Delivered 616 Units In EV-Friendly Norway, Besting Previous No. 1 Vehicle, VW Golf; Can Tesla Maintain This Momentum?",Angelo Young,10/02/13,11:33 AM,"['Tesla Motors Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) did pretty well out of the gate in Norway, one of the world’s most electric-vehicle-friendly nations.September was the first real selling month there for the company’s acclaimed Model S luxury electric car, and, as preliminary mid-month figures suggested, consumers have embraced Norway’s enticing EV incentives to become Tesla’s strongest European market so far.Tesla’s sales performance as it expands globally is being closely watched because, aside from all the attention that has sent the company’s stock price into the realm of irrational exuberance, Tesla’s future success will ride on two simple facts: how many cars the company can sell and how much money it can make selling them.According to Norway’s auto association, the OFV, Tesla delivered 616 units last month, representing just over 5 percent of all car and light truck sales in the affluent country of 5 million people. Tesla ranked seventh place by brand sales volume – behind perennial favorites Volkswagen, Toyota, Volvo, Ford, BMW and Skoda. The Model S outsold the previous top model, the Volkswagen Golf, by 55 units.The fact that Tesla, the Palo-Alto, Calif.-based 10-year-old EV startup, \xa0is even being mentioned on a list of big global players is a real feat, but what’s more striking about September’s figures is that the Model S was the top-selling vehicle by model, leading green-car boosters to swoon.“Well, here\'s a first: The best-selling car in Norway is the Tesla Model S. Not the best-selling electric car. Not the best-selling car with a plug. For the month of September, the Tesla Model S was the best-selling car, period,” writes John Voelcker of Green Car Reports.“They\'ve again underpromised and overdelivered,” writes Mario Kadastick on the Tesla Motors Club\'s website. “At this rate Tesla is going to make quite an impression on the world if they can pull of a serious market penetration in Norway due to the massive incentives.”“Massive incentives” have certainly played a role in Norway’s embracing of clean machines. Norway offers great lures for buyers of electric vehicles, which also has helped sales of the Nissan Leaf. Nissan sold 349 of its EV compact in September and 3,039 of them in the first nine months of 2013, 3 percent more than in the same period last year.While Nissan’s sales are well-established in Norway, Tesla is a new player. Like retail operations, cars get a novelty-factor bump in sales as curious buyers initially flock to a new store or product. But more important, Tesla is starting to fulfill back orders for its Model S, so not all of these deliveries are sales that took place in September.Nevertheless, these figures provide some further indication that the company will more than meet its sales targets for 2013. And it can thank Norway’s generous incentives and wealth for part of that. Tesla will announce its third-quarter earnings early next month. Investors will look first to sales volume and second to margin improvement.\xa0Meanwhile, it looks like Tesla\'s stock might be correcting. On Wednesday Baird downgraded TSLA from ""outperform"" to ""neutral,"" in one of the few bearish notes that have come out in weeks. The news knocked nearly 2 percent off the price, but it\'s still 328 percent higher than it was six months ago.\xa0']"

This despite having sold 0.81 percent of the number of cars Renault delivered in the first half of the year.“From there to bubble talk…” is how French-language LesEchoes.fr described the “almost perfect equality” the two automakers achieved in market capitalization on Monday, as retail Tesla zealot investors (the Teslots) continue to gamble on how far Tesla’s share price can go before the inevitable decline.Even the more bullish estimates for the company’s share price has TSLA reaching $200 a year from now. On Monday it was trading at more than $193 per share, pushing its market value to $23.57 billion. Renault closed trading in Paris on Monday at $23.58 billion. The difference: Tesla sold 10,500 luxury electric cars in the same period – the first six months of the year – that Renault sold 1.3 million. And it’s worth noting that Renault has a long-term commitment to affordable all-electric vehicles – it has four models designed for urban commuters and commercial vehicles.Range continues to be Tesla’s advantage – with a more-than 200-mile range – but Renault (and Nissan, and others) are betting that there’s a market for urban consumers whose driving needs fit within the sub-100-mile range of the smaller city-type vehicles. \xa0But whatever the case may be, there’s little going on with Tesla right now that hasn’t already been known for weeks. Morgan Stanley auto analyst Jonas Adam wrote in a research note last week that he doesn’t expect any “market moving developments” on the introduction of Tesla’s upcoming Model X SUV and (more important) its Gen 3 (likely to be called the Model E) for several months.This hasn’t swayed the Teslot investors, who have added $10 to the price of a share of the company in the past five trading days alone, including the $2.65 it piled on to the stock on Monday based on little more than whatever repetitive chatter and hyperbole is being passed around in the Twittersphere.Meanwhile, it appears the institutional investors have seen the light. While the individual E*Trader continues to pump up the irrational exuberance. As noted by Zerohedge.com, Bank of American Merril Lynch sees institutional investors reducing their positions on Tesla, leaving the average Joe and Jane retail investor to get shafted when the long-overdue correction commences.\xa0CORRECTION: The original story said Tesla sold 0.00081 percent of what Renault sold in the first six months of 2013. In fact, the author (who wrote this correction and is referring to himself in third person) made a calculating mistake. The correct figure is 0.81 percent. Tesla sold less than one percent of the cars Renault sold in the first six months of 2013. That's small, but not nearly as small as originally reported.\xa0""]"

The\xa084th Texas state legislature will convene on January 13, 2015, after which state lawmakers could examine a law that prevents Tesla from selling its cars through its own dealership network.Original story begins here:Tesla Motors Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), maker of a popular electric sports car, has a lot of challenges in its mission to become the car of the future in an industry where there hasn’t been a successful U.S. startup built from the ground-up since Chrysler in 1925.Among the major obstacles to becoming the first maker of a mass-produced electric car with a range of more than 200 miles, the Palo Alto, Calif.-based manufacturer of the acclaimed Model S luxury electric sedan is expanding its global network of retail dealerships. Like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Tesla Motors wants strict control over its retail network: it basically wants to sell cars through slick storefronts as Apple does with its Apple Retail Store operations.But in the U.S., Tesla is hitting a snag: dealers don’t want carmakers intruding into their retail business, and these dealers have forked out huge amounts of cash to either keep Tesla-owned showrooms out of their states, or they are lobbying heavily to get state laws passed to prevent Tesla from directly selling its cars to the public. In states where Tesla cannot operate showrooms, the cars have to be delivered directly to customers who must order the cars online.There’s a push right now in states, including North Carolina and New York, to not only prevent Tesla from opening local outlets, but in New York’s case to force Tesla to dismantle three showrooms, one each in New York City, Westchester and Garden City. The Colorado legislature passed a measure banning Tesla from opening any more stores in the state, but it will allow the current dealership near Denver to continue operations.The impetus seems perplexing at first. For a country like the U.S. that prides itself on being a beacon of the free market it seems antithetical to prevent an entrepreneur like Tesla CEO Elon Musk from going directly to the customer and allowing shoppers to kick tires and test drive cars out of Tesla showrooms.However, dealers say they can’t compete if, for example, a General Motors Co. (NYSE:GM) decided to cut them out and develop their own network or dealerships, because the automakers would have a price advantage. And dealers feel that allowing Tesla to develop its retail network would open the way for other carmakers to do the same.Tesla, hardly a mass-market car maker, claims dealers are just trying to force it to do something it’s loathe to do: give up control of its retail network by either cutting off Tesla Motors’ access to local markets or by forcing it to sell its cars through third-parties, like the ubiquitous car and truck dealerships.The debate has led Tesla fans to establish a White House petition demanding federal intervention to allow Tesla to sell directly to consumers in all 50 states. The petition hit a threshold minimum number of signatures in July, requiring the White House to issue a response. (It hasn’t yet; it usually takes a few months.)Nowhere has this battle played out more dramatically than in Texas, where dealers strike a little-guy David pose and say they risk being trampled by the Goliaths should those giants be allowed to enter the market.Bill Wolters, president of the powerful Texas Automobile Dealers Association (see below) said earlier this year that changing the franchise laws to accommodate Tesla would open the way for other carmakers to swoop in and compete with “our family-owned businesses.”Whether allowing Tesla-owned showrooms into Texas would under any circumstance also allow GM or Toyota to do the same, one thing is pretty clear: the Texas dealers’ market is already highly concentrated, and just four entities have shoveled the lion’s share of dealer-associated political contributions to state and federal officials.According to Texans for Public Justice, an Austin-based group devoted to tracking local political contributions, the following four dealer-associated political donors have given 55 percent of the $2.5 million in campaign contributions in the 2011/12 campaign cycle, of which most have gone to current Republican members of the state’s executive branch. Topping the list of contributions received is Gov. Rick Perry at $257,154, followed by Lt. Gov. Greg Abbot with $224,370.If you filter out smaller contributions from small, family-owned car dealerships, these four donors made up 71 percent of all contributions greater than $15,000. These donors might be fighting for the small dealer-owned business, but if so they’re carrying an enormous amount of the burden of paying for favorable legislation, either selflessly or out of self interest.Here are the most deep pocketed car-dealer political movers in the state of Texas:Thomas H. FriedkinFriedkin, a 78-year-old billionaire, is by far the biggest auto-dealer contributor to Texas politicians. He owns the world’s second-largest Toyota franchise and operates in Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Mississippi and Arkansas.The former actor and stunt pilot founded Gulf States Toyota Distributors in 1968 after the famed late Carroll Shelby, the guy who put American high-performance autos on the world map, turned down Toyota’s offer to become a distributor.Friedkin is Texas royalty. One of his sons, Dan, is chairman of the family-owned holding company that controls the massive Toyota distributor. In 2001 Gov. Rick Perry named Dan to head the Texas Parks and Wildlife Commission, a nod to Thomas’s lifelong devotion to both environmental conservation and big-game hunting.Friedkin’s share of all car-dealer contributions to Texas politicians in 2011/12: 18 percent, or $453,324. But that\'s not all.Gulf States Toyota PAC, through which members of the Friedkin family, including Thomas, have contributed, is the second-largest Texas-dealer associated donor to political causes in 2011/12. Virtually everyone on the list of 2012 contributors to the PAC was affiliated in some way with Gulf States Toyota Distributors, according to OpenSecrets.org. Money going through the PAC was distributed to U.S. House and Senate lawmakers in every state in which the dealership operates.The PAC was the second-largest Texas dealer-associated political contributor with 13 percent of the total for 2011/12. Together, Thomas H. Friedkin and the Gulf States Toyota PAC represented a whopping 31 percent of all Texas car dealer-associated political contributions.Billy Joe “Red” McCombs McCombs, 86, is a Texas entrepreneurial legend and the second-biggest individual auto-dealer contributor to Texas politicians. The self-made billionaire college dropout is the co-founder of mass media giant Clear Channel Communications, Inc. and chairman of the controversial private-military operator Academi (more commonly known by its former name Blackwater Worldwide), as well as the former owner of the San Antonio Spurs, Denver Nuggets and the Minnesota Vikings. He owns San Antonio-based Red McCombs Auto Group.The percentage of McCombs\' contributions to Texas politicians in 2011 and 2012 out of the $2.5 million car dealers contributed: \xa012 percent, or $306,500.Texas Auto Dealers Association PACThe TADA appears\xa0devoted mainly to keeping Texas Republican incumbents in office. Its biggest recipients have been Texas Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst, state Comptroller Susan Combs, state Attorney General Greg Abbot and Gov. Rick Perry.In 2011/12, TADA doled out $285,750 in political contributions in the state, representing 11 percent of total dealer-associated contributions.\xa0']"

What was interesting to me about Tesla is it was the first company to focus on making an electric car with a range over 200 miles. Eighty miles per charge just isn’t enough.”But now Bashover is offering his white 2013 Model S with the extended range battery, xenon headlamps, heated leather seats and about 9,000 miles on the odometer. The asking price: $101,000, above the starting price of about $71,000 but less than the price of a new version of the car with the same options.Though the optometrist was coy about why he’s selling his car so quickly (he says he owns two Priuses and an old Jaguar sports car) he insists it’s not because he’s been disappointed with the way the Tesla performs, or how much it has cost him to maintain. He estimates that he’s paying in nightly recharges from his home charger the equivalent of driving a car that gets 140 miles to the gallon.“And there really is something to the fact that there are no gears. You don’t have the oil and the fluids of a gas engine,” he added.Founded in 2003, Tesla Motors Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) may be younger than the average age of a passenger car rolling on U.S. streets (11 years), but already there are Tesla vehicles showing up on used car lots. There aren’t many, and most of them have very few miles – almost none over 30,000 – but vehicles like these will be watched by the industry to gauge their resale value and to meter their long-term maintenance cost and dependability.How this first batch of used cars fares in the aftermarket is important to the company because any Tesla customer who finances the purchase through the company’s unconventional financing program (in partnership with Wells Fargo and U.S. Bancorp) is guaranteed to receive 43 percent of the original purchase price after three years. Bloomberg Industries recently estimated that this “gamble” could bring Telsa $368 million in annual revenue by 2016 if the company can sell 10,000 used Teslas annually by 2016 at the average resale price of $36,763.Right now the oldest and most worn Teslas being sold online are the Roadsters – built between 2008 and 2012 on the Lotus Elise chassis – including one with a premium carbon fiber top and 35,000 miles listing on Craigslist in Los Angeles for $74,500. A review of used car sites such as cars.com and autotrader.com yielded fewer than 50 Teslas, most of them with less than 1,000 miles. Very few used Model S sedans have more than 10,000 miles, and all of them cost significantly more than any entry-level luxury sedan.Kelley Blue Book, the auto pricing information site, has yet to list Tesla’s estimated used car value. It’s customers like Bashover who are testing the waters to see at what price a used Tesla will settle. And that value will determine just how much revenue (much less profit) Tesla will be able to generate with its buyback guarantee.In the meantime, the cheapest Tesla in the world right now appears to be this one:']"

(NASDAQ:TSLA) has been given a bump to its European expansion.According to data compiled by U.K.-based Automotive Industry Data (AID), the Palo Alto-based luxury electric sedan manufacturer has delivered at least 322 units in Norway in the first half of September. The country’s vehicle registry the OFV reported 185 units sales in August, Tesla’s debut month in Norway.That means consumers in Europe’s most electric-vehicle-friendly country have purchased more than 500 Model S sedans, giving Tesla a solid start in its Norwegian face-off with the nation's \xa0No. 1 selling electric sedan,\xa0Nissan Motor Co., Ltd.'s Leaf (TYO:7201).OFV says electric cars represented 6 percent of the 11,660 new cars the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association said were sold in Norway in August. If Tesla maintains its momentum it could overtake the Nissan Leaf in September. The novelty of Tesla in the country is probably giving the brand a sales bounce.Norway’s generous incentives for electric car ownership give it a unique spot in Europe’s EV market, which is why Tesla has made it a priority. In addition to government subsidies for EV purchases, green vehicle owners get to ride ferries for free, get free charges at public charging stations (in addition to Telsa’s own Superchargers) and free parking.Some in Norway have criticized what they consider overly generous incentives. They say what is ostensibly aimed at price equalization has actually dropped the cost of EV ownership below those of nonelectric vehicles.The Norwegian auto site BilNorge.no reported last week that it estimates the total government subsidy for owning a Tesla in Norway – taking into consideration all incentives for the lifetime of the car, including annual taxes – amounts to between 500,000 and 700,000 krone ($90,000 to $126,000). “The truth is that a luxury Tesla Model S car can be purchased for 450,000 krone (about $81,000), which is about half of comparable models from Audi, BMW and Mercedes-Benz,” said a report on the Norwegian-language site.Norway is the only European country where Tesla already has more than one dealership – in Oslo and Trondheim. The company has short-term plans to open 28 dealerships in 11 European countries, including six stores in Germany, five in Norway and four in the Netherlands.Overall, electric vehicle sales in Europe are being pummeled by the larger crisis in the auto sector there. Western Europe bought 2,313 EVs in July, according to AID, which tracks Europe’s EVs sales. Sales were down from the previous year in France, the Netherlands, Sweden, Belgium, Denmark, Finland and Ireland. In Norway, EV sales grew 8.6 percent, to 278 units. Tesla didn’t begin selling in Norway in earnest until August, so most of July’s Norway EV sales went to Nissan.\xa0""]"

It’s gained almost 490 percent of its value over the past 12 months, over 400 percent in the past six months, about 80 percent since June and almost 10 percent this week. \xa0On Friday, the price touched the all-time high for the second day in a row, hitting almost $186 a share. \xa0This is the kind of momentum that strikes concern in the hearts of traditional, conservative buy-and-hold investors but seems All-American though the eyes of statistically less successful short-term traders.Tesla Motors Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), the maker of the world’s first all-electric full size sedan to top 200 miles in range, the critically acclaimed Model S, may be capturing hearts and minds in the same way Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) converted millions of people into die-hard fanatics, but with over a month to go before the company will tell the world how far it’s gotten to meeting its annual goals in its quarterly earnings report, the stock's price explosion seems to be driven largely by analysts telling potential investors that the stock could go higher before it starts to retreat.Helping pump up the price of the stock: The ceaseless chatter from the die-hard Teslanaires and Teslots, as well as the occasional coy comment from CEO Elon Musk. A day after Musk boldly declared to the Financial Times in a report published Tuesday that he would have auto pilot in his cars by 2017 that could handle 90 percent of all driving, Musk took to his Twitter account, issuing a call to arms for engineers, a “Help Wanted” that suggests the autopilot plan hasn’t yet entered any formidable stage of solid development.Thursday’s 7 percent TSLA gain came after Deutsche Bank analysts Dan Galves, Rod Lache, Mike Levin and Patrick Nola issued a buy recommendation, saying in their research report that the stock could still rocket to $200 over the next 12 months.“Based on conversations with [Tesla] mgmt and monitoring information available on Tesla owners’ blogs, we believe that the company is on-track to modestly outperform Q3 margin expectations, that demand has continued to grow in the U.S. and Europe . . . and that the production rate at Tesla’s factory has continued to increase,” the report said.Then -- big surprise -- investors rushed to their E*Trade accounts and piled nearly $12 onto the price of a share. That momentum continued on Friday despite no new relevant information. The Deutsche Bank note came out a day after Morgan Stanley said the stock was overweight, meaning investors should hold but not necessarily buy.“Incremental buyers are scared to wade in,” said Morgan Stanley’s Adam Jonas in the note co-researched by Ravi Shanker, Yejay Ying and Paresh Jain. “It’s understandably hard to put fresh money to work with a stock chart that looks like Tesla’s.”Tesla is in line to meet its gross margin and sales target for the year. It’s reportedly fixing supply bottleneck issues, is churning out over 500 cars a week, and sending many of them to Europe as it begins its global unveil.But it has yet to make a profit purely from selling cars rather than boosting itself into the green with carbon credit sales in California and some creative (but of course completely legal and transparent) non-GAAP accounting measures. \xa0The company’s third-quarter results will be released in early November. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect net income of $12 million, or 11 cents per share, on revenue of $518 million. Gross margin is expected to grow to 22.6 percent compared to negative 16.6 percent in the same \xa0quarter last year; Musk has said he will meet or break 25 percent by the end of the year.But whether you’re a Tesladdict or not, one thing is clear: There is a rational price for a share of Tesla stock, and it’s either already above that or it's reaching critical mass.""]"

Tesla makes a beautiful, innovative and pricey luxury sedan. Duesenberg (from where the idiom “it’s a doozy” originates) made a beautiful, innovative, pricey luxury sedan.Duesenberg Automobile & Motors Company, Inc. made the first American passenger vehicle with hydraulic brakes and a straight-8 engine, whose elongated, smoother-running configuration led to an era of long and elegant luxury cars. Tesla has made the first mass-produced electric car battery that breaks the 200-mile range and packaged it in what is widely viewed as a beautiful driving machine.Despite winning accolades for three victories at the Indianapolis 500, Duesenberg went out of business after 24 years, in 1937, in large part because the car was just too expensive -- the Great Depression didn\'t help create more rich people who could afford it, either. Simply put, there wasn’t enough demand for Duesenberg cars, of which only a few hundred of four models were ever made. At the time, a boring old Ford Model T, which was being produced at a rate of about 2 million every year in the 20s, cost less than $300, or about $5,100 in today\'s dollars. According to ""American Horsepower: 100 Years of Great Car Engines,"" by Mike Mueller, the\xa0Duesenberg was priced above $6,000 in the 20s. In today\'s dollars that\'s $102,000, or about the same price as a Tesla Model S if you buy it with the best battery and numerous options.\xa0What Duesenberg\'s story proves is that in a capital-intensive industry such as automobiles, a great car doesn\'t secured a win. And the competition doesn\'t sit idle and watch a great product succeed; it learns, adapts and innovates to build a better car, or at least an adequate car accessible to a wider pool of consumers.\xa0Which is what General Motors (NYSE:GM) and other mass producers are trying to do right now.On Monday, Doug Parks, GM’s vice president of global products, told a group of journalists touring the company’s car battery laboratory and testing facility in Warren, Mich., that North America’s largest car company has the technology now to build an electric car that matches the 200-plus-mile range of Tesla’s Model S, and that it’s working on the technology and scale to get the price down to $30,000.“If General Motors can meet the price and performance target of a $30,000 electric car with a 200-mile range, it could be the first real mainstream, volume-selling electric car,” said Karl Brauer, senior analyst at Kelley Blue Book. “The success of Tesla suggests that while a 100-mile driving range is insufficient, a 200-mile range can satisfy the needs of most consumers. Everybody agrees the technology and cost structure will eventually make such a car possible. If GM can be the first to offer it, it will enhance both their market share and their image.”Tesla Motors Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) currently has one car, the Model S, which starts at $70,000 without the pricey add-ons that can send the car into six-figure territory. Its efforts to lure customers to this hefty price tag got the company slapped on Monday with accusations from California car dealers that it’s inflating claims in its advertising.Meanwhile other car manufacturers, including Nissan Motor Co. (TYO:7201), which leads the world in electric car sales with its LEAF, and GM are working hard to boost range (the distance an electric car can travel on one charge before it stalls) while offering that below-$40,000 price tag that would make the first mainstream electric vehicle. Last week Germany’s Volkswagen AG (FRA:VOW3) announced its intention to become the world’s top electric-car seller by 2018.Right now Tesla is a leader in the luxury electric car segment precisely because it has also been unable to develop a more affordable battery system. In other words, just as Duesenberg had to charge over $6,000 for a boutique car to deliver the desired performance at the time, Tesla is a luxury carmaker because the technology and scale prevents a cheaper, longer-range electric car from getting to the market.The Model E, also known as the “Gen 3,” Tesla’s touted cheaper electric sedan, is not expected to be available for another two years. This gives auto giant GM time to develop, for example, an all-electric Chevy Volt.Meanwhile, currently exhibiting at the Frankfurt auto show are a number of electric and electric hybrids with better all-electric ranges. While they aren’t hitting Tesla’s sweet spot of over 200 miles, these ranges will be getting longer in the coming years. The new i3 5-door hatchback by Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (FRA:BMW), the world’s top luxury carmaker, boasts a maximum range of 118 miles, which is just adequate for drivers in densely populated urban environments.For its part Tesla successfully patented in July an extended range hybrid battery pack system that it claims will increase range by about 40 percent and boost battery life by 30 percent. On Monday, Global Equities analyst Trip Chowdhry estimated that this new technology could be in Tesla cars by 2015.What we’re seeing here is a race between Tesla and its competitors to make electric vehicles mainstream. But like all auto company startups of the past century, Tesla is facing incredible odds. Ford was able to help drive Duesenberg into insolvency by simply being able to sell a lot of cars at a significantly lower price, even if they weren’t as pretty and didn‘t perform as well.Duesenberg lasted 24 years building beautiful, well-performing cars. Tesla’s ability to be around on its 24th birthday in 2027 will depend largely on it ability to avoid making similar mistakes, such as relying solely on deep-pocketed enthusiasts rather than the mainstream buyer.\xa0']"

(NASDAQ:TSLA) to be valued at $165, just eight bucks and change under the 52-week high of nearly $174 it touched late last month. Compare that to just six months ago, when the price was under $40, and you start wondering if the share price is being pumped up by the hype following a string of positive recent developments for the maker of the critically acclaimed luxury electric Model S.Yes, it has been deemed one of the safest cars on the market, it’s being sold globally, its national Supercharger network in the U.S. is growing fast— but the latest official figure has sales at under 11,000 units for the first half of\xa0 the year. By comparison, Nissan’s Leaf has sold more than 70,000 units worldwide since it debuted in 2010, the year Tesla went public, and U.S. consumers bought more than 10,000 electric cars in August alone. The Model S is a luxury sedan and right now the only significant player in this segment. What happens when the Germans pile into the luxury EV (and plug-in hybrid) game?Tesla is on its way to topping 20,000 unit sales for 2013 – and the Model S may become the No. 1-selling EV in the U.S. (we won’t know until Tesla releases updated numbers) -- but that volume still makes Tesla a boutique carmaker in an increasingly crowded niche for green (or greener plug-in-hybrid) machines.Showing up at the 65th International Motor Show in Frankfurt that kicked off on Tuesday are the BMW i8 city car, the Volkswagen e-Golf, the Mercedes S 500 plug-in hybrid as well as a slew of electric and plug-in hybrid concepts. This means that moving forward Tesla is going to see more competition.The latest call for rational exuberance has come from Barclay’s Research, which estimates that a year from now a share of the company’s stock will be priced anywhere between $87 and $279. Where it will be in this broad range hinges on Tesla’s ability to become both a mass market producer and one with a lower-cost so-called Gen 3 model on the market, “even though uncertainty still exists in both cases,” according to this week’s research note from Barclays’ analysts Brian A. Johnson, Dan Levy and Steven Hempel.This sober assessment comes less than two months after Goldman Sachs automotive analyst Patrick Archambault estimated a near-term stock price range of $58 to $113 depending on the company’s ability to pump up volume sales and get the Gen 3 to market. And for the stock to be valued at $113, Archambault estimates Tesla on its way to selling 250,000 units five years from now.Tesla CEO Elon Musk says the company will be selling 40,000 units by the end of 2015. For the stock to be valued higher 12 months from now than it is right now, Tesla has to become a mass producer of luxury electric cars. That means scaling up revenue to the level of a major car company. Tesla’s revenue for the past year stands at $1.3 billion. Compare that to the world’s second-largest luxury automaker, Audi, which reported $65 billion-plus in revenue in the same period.The upcoming, stylish Model X Tesla SUV will certainly help generate more cash flow, but the company needs a lower-cost vehicle on the market ASAP. Nothing short of a buyout from a major player in the auto industry would justify a stock price in the same league as current mass producers.\xa0']"

Musk developed a system of designing and manufacturing using that Musk thinks will revolutionize manufacturing in the 21st century.Inspired by the “Iron Man” movies -- for which Musk actually inspired director Jon Favreau’s depiction of Tony Stark -- Musk developed a system that allows engineers to design complex parts using hand gestures through the air and instantly create it. The technology uses Leap Motion hands-free controllers, Oculus Rift virtual reality and 3D printing.\xa0We figured out how to design rocket parts just w hand movements through the air (seriously). Now need a high frame rate holograph generator.â€” Elon Musk (@elonmusk) August 23, 2013Will post video next week of designing a rocket part with hand gestures & then immediately printing it in titanium— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) August 23, 2013Musk hinted at the technology Aug. 23 on Twitter and released a video Thursday:“Right now we interact with computers in a very unnatural, sort of 2D way,” Musk said in the video. His design aims to make design more of an organic process.The technology uses a Leap Motion Controller and technology from Siemens that SpaceX used to design the Merlin rocket. Musk’s team wrote some code to integrate the two and developed a system for controlling and manipulating wire frame designs in three dimensions using natural hand motions through the air.What began as a fun project spawned an idea for manipulating full 3D CAD models. The team adapted the system for 3D projections wearing glasses and eventually to a free-standing glass projection like the kind seen I the “Iron Man” movies.Musk then incorporated Oculus Rift, a virtual reality system originally developed for video games. Oculus Rift tracks head position, creating an immersive experience that makes the object feel like it is right there in front of the designer.“If you can just go in there and do what you need to do, just understanding the fundamentals of how the things should work as opposed to figuring out to make the computer make it work, then you can achieve a lot more in a lot shorter period of time,” Musk said. “Really apply your intuition and take something from your mind to a physical object with far greater ease than we currently do.”The CAD designs are the kind used in 3D printing, so as soon as an object is designed it can be created with a 3D printer.“I believe we’re on the verge of a major breakthrough in designer manufacturing in being able to take the concept of something fro your mind, translate that into a 3D object really intuitively on the computer, and then take that virtual 3d object and make it real just by printing,” Musk said. \xa0“It’s going to revolutionize DM in the 21st century.”\xa0']"

This time it’s about something that matters: convincing American drivers that they need not worry about running out of battery power in the middle of South Dakota.On Thursday morning the founder of SpaceX and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) tweeted that he would be taking a family road trip across the United States in his critically acclaimed Tesla Model S, in an effort to show America that his company is working hard to overcome the range anxiety that is keeping many car buyers from embracing the gospel of electric-only transport.Musk didn’t offer many details, except to say his 3,200-mile, six-day itinerary has been planned out. When this trip will take place and by what route is a matter of speculation.This won’t be the first time someone has driven a Tesla coast to coast – Telsa owner Bill Clarke of Maryland won that crown when he drove from San Francisco to D.C. last year, which he chronicled on his blog.But Musk’s family trip will be different. When Clarke did his cross-country trip he used Tesla’s NEMA adapters that allowed him to charge using various methods, such as electrical outlets at RV parks. Musk plans to showcase his Superchargers.“Elon is planning a road trip from L.A. to N.Y. in his Model S using the Tesla Supercharger network,” Tesla spokesman Alexis Georgeson told International Business Times by email on Thursday, referring to the company’s expanding network of proprietary charging stations. “He will only be charging at Tesla Supercharger stations on his trip (not utilizing public charging stations therefore he will not need to bring an adaptor).”To do that anytime soon, Musk will have to stick to a route that will take him out of Los Angeles, up to Utah and northwestern Colorado. After that, his itinerary will have to follow a narrow corridor through Wyoming, South Dakota, and southern Minnesota on his way to Chicago. After that, Musk’s options expand; he could even taunt Detroit on a pass into Canada and back into upstate New York, or just barrel on through Pennsylvania and New Jersey into the Big Apple.As to when this could happen, it depends on how quickly the Supercharger stations are up and running in the central part of this route. This map from Tesla’s website (above) shows a lot of gray dots between California and Wisconsin/Illinois into the winter. We can probably assume Musk has made those stations high priorities to be ready by the end of the year—if not sooner.\xa0']"
https://www.ibtimes.com/tesla-motors-tsla-trademark-problem-china-what-multinational-companies-can-learn-1401973,Tesla Motors’ (TSLA) Trademark Problem In China: What Multinational Companies Can Learn From Tesla About Securing A Trademark On The Mainland,Angelo Young,08/30/13,9:06 PM,"[""When it comes to securing intellectual property rights in China, foreign companies would be well-advised to take Laurence Thoo’s advice.“Prevention is very much better than the cure,” said the partner at Hong-Kong-based Letters & Thoo, which specializes in procurement and enforcement of patent, design and trademark rights in Asia. “Unfortunately, many foreign companies don’t seem to have learned from the mistakes of more high-profile companies that have been burned in China by bad-faith trademark registrations.”One of those high-profile cases involved Italian sports car manufacturer Ferrari SpA, which in 2007 lost a decade-long legal battle over a Chinese department store’s use of a rearing-horse very similar to Ferrari's on a line of athletic clothing. In that case, 10 years of costly legal wrangling failed to cure the problem. A Chinese court ruled that Ferrari could not challenge the local company's trademark because Ferrari was not well-enough known in China.Western companies consistently encounter problems like this when they set up operations in China, and the situation isn’t likely to change much even though on Friday China’s legislature passed a new trademark law that greatly increases the penalties for trademark violations. Litigators with expertise on the matter all underscore the importance of getting a lead on those seeking to profit off brand identities. This is a game that plays out constantly in mainland China, and elsewhere for that matter, with people or companies seeking to cash in on foreign brand identities by securing local commercial rights to their logos and names.Fundamentally, the game is a race to see who can get the rubber stamp from the Chinese Trademark Office. Whoever gets a mark registered first usually wins. If the company loses, it’s stuck with two expensive options: Fight it out in court or buy the trademark from the locally registered owner. Last year, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) forked over $60 million to settle a lawsuit brought on by a local tech company that had registered the “iPad” name a decade before Apple released its first tablet computer.As the Apple and Ferrari examples illustrate, companies end up paying millions more to claim trademark rights later than it costs to secure the rights earlier. For example, registering a company logo and its name, including in Chinese characters (three separate trademarks), would cost about $4,000 for each class of products that would carry the marks. On the other hand, the potential cost of buying rights to these marks claimed by someone else can run into the millions.The latest high-profile trademark dispute involves U.S. luxury electric car maker Tesla Motors Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), which is currently trying to assert its claim in China to its “T”-shaped badge and company logo from Zhan Baosheng, a young Chinese businessman who claims to be a legitimate electric-car entrepreneur seeking to make and market a “Tesla” electric sedan in China.Back in 2006, Zhan filed two Tesla-related claims with the China Trademark Office. He claimed the rights to the word “Tesla” in English and the phonetic translation of “Tesla” in Chinese characters. Then, in 2009, he filed trademark rights to Tesla Motors’ T-shaped badge (the icon you see on the Tesla Model S sedan’s fascia) and Tesla’s company logo -- which includes the badge, the words “Tesla Motors” and the word “Tesla” in the company’s distinctive typeface.It’s those last two, the badge and the logo, that are the most egregious; staking the name “Tesla” is one thing; claiming a company’s logo designs is another — but not necessarily in the eyes of the law.Zhan has claimed in interviews with the Chinese press that he is an admirer of the 19th century Serbian-American electrical engineer Nicolas Tesla, is sincere in his efforts to introduce an electric sports sedan in China, and that he owns the right to the word “Tesla” to make and market vehicles. But critics in China have accused him of simply trying to blackmail Tesla by holding its logo and name hostage, a process casually described as trademark trolling.Fighting The TrollsWhile trolling is illegal under Chinese law, proving that the local owner of a company’s trademark is trolling is more difficult in China than it is in the United States, Britain and even Hong Kong, which operates under a separate legal system than the mainland.China is a so-called civil code country, which means its trademark law is dictated by statute that can only be revised by changes implemented by executive or legislative powers. This differs from common-law countries, comprised largely of Britain and its former colonies, including the United States, in which changes to the law occur by the courts establishing legal precedents, drawing on past rulings to establish new ones.“In civil code countries, the law rules, the statute itself rules,” Mary M. Squyres, chair of the International Trademark Practice Group at Brinks Hofer Gilson & Lione in Chicago, told International Business Times. “In most civil code countries, China included, if you are first to file, you win.”There’s an exception: Under the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property, a 130-year-old, occasionally updated global accord aimed at protecting “well-known marks,” companies can sometimes overcome local statutes if they can establish that their trademarks are well-known. Most countries in the world abide by the convention, but they reserve the right to determine for themselves if a mark is well-known locally.“China is really big on saying, ‘If you’re going to prove that your mark is well-known, you’re going to have to prove that it’s well-known in China,’” Squyres observed. “I would guess that is what Tesla is trying to do right now.”In other words, the McDonald’s golden arches, Mickey Mouse and the Ford Motor Company blue oval logo have had considerably more trademark protection in China, but a Chinese court can decide whether or not a mark is well-known locally – which puts newer companies like Tesla at a disadvantage compared with known and long-established global brands.High Burden Of ProofChina’s trademark law places a high burden of proof on a company trying to prove that the owner of a trademark is acting in bad faith. Tesla must convince an administrative court that Zhan is simply trying to extort money from the company, which will not be easy.“It is extremely difficult to regain any trademark from a trademark ‘troll’ unless the foreign company’s mark is well-known in China prior to the filing of the mark or the trademark ‘troll’ has prior dealing with the foreign company so that bad faith can be established,” Catherine Zhang, an intellectual property lawyer and partner at Deacons, a Hong Kong-based commercial law firm, told IBTimes.In other words, Tesla must prove the register-holder had some direct connection with the company in the past and knew it was planning a move into mainland China. Then, it must also convince the court that its brand was well-known in China at the time the defendant registered the trademark. Zhan could argue that in 2006, when he registered his trademark claims, the Tesla brand was not well-known in China. Tesla was founded in 2003 and went public three years ago. Zhan also had no previous connection to Tesla.May Chan, an intellectual rights litigator for Ella Cheong, a law firm with offices in Hong Kong and Beijing that specializes in China patent, design and trademark issues, says companies that cannot convince a court that their trademarks are well-known in China could be out of luck. “Without valid evidence of actual use and fame in China, it would be a difficult if not impossible to attack and cancel an improper registration,” she told IBTimes by email.Is Tesla Motors Legally Using Its Own Logo In Beijing Right Now?\xa0For the time being, both Zhan and Tesla are using Tesla trademarks in China: Zhan on his “Tesla” website, which is hosted through three “tesla” Web addresses, and Tesla on its website announcing it will open its first showroom in Beijing by January. It’s not currently clear which party has legal rights to these marks because the Trademark Office has put Zhan’s registration on hold, claiming an unnamed party (presumably Tesla) requested adjudication.Whether Tesla will win the right to call its car “Tesla” and legally use the logo and badge it created will partially rest on whether it can convince a judge it was known well enough in 2006 that Zhan strategically planned to grab its trademark in order to force the company to fork over cash. Tesla CEO Elon Musk reportedly offered Zhan about $300,000 in 2009 for the trademarks, but Zhan responded by brazenly offering Musk the opportunity to be a co-investor in his company for more than $3 million. In court, Tesla could argue that Zhan attempted to grab trademarks for at least three other companies in recent years, but that might not be sufficient to prove bad faith was involved. Tesla spokesman Alexis Georgeson told IBTimes on Wednesday that the company is not commenting on the issue at this time.China's New Trademark Law Is A Step In The Right Direction, But...Because China is a civil code country, any changes to its trademark law come from the National People’s Congress Standing Committee rather than through legal precedents in the courts, as it’s done in common-law countries.After two years and three revisions, China’s legislature on Friday passed a new trademark law. The reforms increase the penalty for trademark infringement from 500,000 yuan (about $82,000) to 3 million (nearly $500,000), according to the official Xinhua news agency.China’s trademark law has been revised two other times since it was established in 1982. In 2001, when China joined the World Trade Organization, the law was amended to recognize the Paris Convention rules for elevated protections of “well-known” brands.The new law puts greater responsibility on trademark agents, under threat of fines and suspension of business, to avoid working with clients whom they know, or should know, are infringing on the trademark rights of others. It also protects well-known trademarks even if these brand names have not been locally registered.However, the high-profile trademarks must be well-known in China, not just in the West or in the United States, and so the law does little to help start-ups like Tesla claim rights to their own logos.Moreover, the law still requires companies challenging trademark holders to prove that the defendants had prior interactions with them, and that they acted in bad faith by using their knowledge of a planned entry into the mainland to extort money from the company by staking claim to their trademarks. But the reforms do indicate that China is becoming more proactive in trying to address its bad reputation as the world’s largest patent and trademark infringer.China is a major world player now, and local brands such as Baoding-based auto maker Great Wall Motors and computer hardware maker Lenovo Group of Beijing will encounter their own trademark hassles in other civil code countries. As they face the same issues that foreign companies have faced in China, we may see further revisions to their trademark law that will help boost protections. \xa0“As Chinese companies go global, which they are, and they find this same problem in another civil code country, they’re going to lobby their people to change the law in China, so that’s a piece of good news,” said Squyres. “Nonetheless, that will take some time. China is not nearly as bad as it used to be, but it’s still one of the worst in stealing marks and holding companies like Tesla [at] ransom.”""]"

Tesla offers compatibility for fast-charger networks preferred by U.S. and European automakers. Currently the Model S sedan cannot be charged at CHAdeMO chargers, but the company has an adapter for CCS compatibility.Original story begins here:\xa0To give an idea of just how fast the infrastructure for plug-in vehicles is expanding, in 2012 the U.S. had only 12 rapid-charging stations fitted to top off plug-ins like the Toyota Prius and Nissan Leaf; last year that number grew to 154, not counting Tesla Motors’ fast-growing proprietary supercharger network.The verdict is still out on whether the world is ready to adopt all-electric vehicles, but with automakers rolling out new plug-in hybrids and 100 percent EV city cars, the quick-charge infrastructure needs are apparent.Fast-charging is vital to wider adoption of plug-in and all-electric vehicles because with the current technology, charging time is knocked down from at least four hours to about 20 minutes. A partial fast-charge wouldn’t take much longer than refueling a combustion engine. Reducing charge time, increasing range-per-charge and building more charging stations are the major prerequisites for wider EV adoption.\xa0    IHS Automotive sees the number of fast-charge stations for electric and plug-in hybrids growing to 199,000 by 2020.  Photo: IHS Inc/IBTimes  “The length of time it takes to recharge an EV continues to be one of the major stumbling blocks inhibiting the widespread adoption of electric vehicles,” said Alastair Hayfield, associate research director at IHS Automotive. “If EV auto manufacturers could overcome this obstacle, it could lead to a high rate of adoption from environmentally minded consumers as well as those seeking to cut gasoline expenses. That’s where fast charging comes in.”According to the IHS report issued Tuesday, the number of fast-charge networks is expected to grow from 1,800 last year to 199,000 by 2020. This bodes well for makers of these chargers, including Switzerland’s ABB Ltd (NYSE:ABB), France’s Schneider Electric SA (EPA:SU) and U.S.-based AeroVironment, Inc. (NASDAQ:AVAV).But as the market for plug-in vehicles grows – fueled by more robust demand for hybrids than for 100 percent electrics, at least for the time being – two general standards are emerging: CHAdeMO, promoted by Japanese car companies, and CCS, embraced by the North Americans and Europeans.With the world’s top two automakers, Toyota Motor Corporation (TYO:7203) and General Motors Co. (NYSE:GM), using different standards, the makers of high-voltage direct current charging stations will for the long term have to accommodate both CHAdeMO (which the abbreviation for “Charge de Move”) and CCS\xa0 (which stands for “Combined Charging System”) in order to offer the serve the widest possible audience.Electric-only and plug-in hybrid vehicles that use the Japanese standard include the Nissan Leaf, Honda Fit EV, the Mitsubishi i-MiEv, the Prius Plug-in Hybrid and the Honda Accord Plug-in Hybrid. Automakers Volkswagen AG (FRA:VOW3), Daimler AG (FRA:DAI),\xa0 Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (FRA:BMW), Chrysler Group LLC, Ford Motor Co. (NYSE:F) are all using the CCS standard.There are currently almost 2,500 CHAdeMO charging stations servicing about 57,000 EVs worldwide, according to HIS, which doesn’t sound like much until you consider that half of those chargers were installed last year, ahead of a rollout of new plug-in models (including hybrids) coming out this year. In the U.S., for example, the number of CHAdeMo charging stations increased to 154 from 12 the previous year, according to Nissan Europe.Where does Tesla Motors Inc (Nasdaq:TSLA) fit into all of this?It doesn’t. The maker of (arguably, see below) the best-selling all-electric car in the U.S. is building its own proprietary network that it expects to cover the entire United States by 2015, rolling out service stations in a similar fashion to the way telecom companies gradually expand their service network footprints.\xa0* Because Tesla only annouces auto sales in its quarterly reports while other auto makers report every month, claims in the media that the Model S is outselling the Nissan Leaf, which has been the most popular electric car by U.S. sales volume, are based on projecting Tesla\'s current monthly sales based on past performance. Nissan sold 11,703 Leafs in the U.S. in the first seven months of the year while Tesla sold 10,055 units in the first two quarters of 2013 ended June. In any case these two electric cars are competing in separate segments and are neck-and-neck in terms of claiming the No. 1 spot in U.S. electric car sales.\xa0--Correction: An earlier version of this story stated that Tesla’s proprietary charging system means Tesla owners cannot use general public charging stations. As readers pointed out, the Model S comes with a mobile connector for use on J1772 charging stations. The adapter works with all CCS-compliant public stations. Tesla also offers universal mobile connectors for common NEMA electric outlets, such as ones used for home washers and dryers.

Tesla Faces More Than Just A Trademark Dispute,Angelo Young,08/28/13,5:56 AM,"[""Tesla may have underestimated China’s red tape.The Palo Alto, Calif., maker of the luxury Model S sedan is keeping largely mum on details of its efforts to meet a year-end goal of selling cars in China, but the campaign is causing considerable chatter in the Chinese press.Tesla Motors, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is betting that its entry into the world’s biggest auto market will help boost its unit sales, an important and closely watched metric for a company that has yet to offer up any significant profit but currently has nearly a third of Ford Motor Co.’s (NYSE:F) \xa0market capitalization. Excited investors are shoveling capital at Tesla right now without much expectation of returns in the short term, but every quarter they’re reading the latest sales numbers. (Unlike other auto companies, Tesla isn't currently revealing monthly volume reports.) Because of the enthusiasm for the innovative electric-car startup, the company’s share price has gone nuclear since the start of the year, rising nearly 400 percent to top $166 on Tuesday.Tesla’s bumpy entry into the People’s Republic isn't just about the ongoing row with Zhan Baosheng, a young Chinese man who's either (as he claims) a legitimate electric auto entrepreneur who wants to use Tesla’s name and logo or is a habitual trademark squatter seeking millions from the company to buy back its rights.While the carmaker has already successfully registered its wholesale operations, that only establishes Tesla as a foreign company operating in mainland China. It doesn't allow the company to actually deliver cars there. To do that, it needs the following: authorization to establish itself as the sole distributor of its cars; a so-called 3C compulsory certification from the government’s product-quality watchdog; and approval from national and local environmental protection regulators.Reports\xa0The Economic Observer:Luo Lei, deputy secretary-general of China Automobile Dealers Association, says that everything Tesla has done is in line with the law, but it’s still likely to get delayed in particular by the 3C certification. Since electric cars are relatively new, there’s still no clear process for getting a 3C for them in China, so he estimates that the step will take at least six months.\xa0Luo says finding a local partner would help expedite the process, but he thinks Tesla has ruled this out because it would be difficult to find a partner willing to wait very long for a return on investment. China has been heavily promoting electric vehicles as a way to reduce urban CO2 emissions and dependence on oil imports, but since the Model S is a foreign brand in a luxury segment, it’s not likely to get any local government endorsement or help with market penetration.China lately seems to be targeting foreign cars. Regulators are reportedly looking into whether or not foreign automakers are overcharging Chinese customers, and BMW recently hit an unexpected administrative snag opening a factory. Beijing also would definitely like to see more of its people buying homemade electric vehicles, as it has strategized for years on how to spur domestic demands for the country's brands.Last week, Tesla announced on Weibo, China’s version of Twitter, that it would begin taking preorders in China. That suggests it’s in line to be open for business come Jan. 1, but whether that means simply taking preorders, or actually fulfilling them, has yet to be determined. We won't know for sure until the company makes an announcement, and it’s not compelled to say anything about its operations in China until November, when it releases its third-quarter results.\xa0""]"

As USA Today notes, the Tesla Model S electric sedan outsold other luxury brands in California during the first half of 2013.According to a report by the California New Car Dealers Association (CNCDA), the Tesla Model S tallied 4,714 vehicle registrations over the first six months of the year, topping all models from brands like Porsche, Volvo, Jaguar, Land Rover, Lincoln and Buick.Other luxury models, like Audi A6 and Lexus GS, received only 1,619 and 2,298 registrations respectively.Despite its success, the Tesla Model S did not claim the top spot. That honor goes to the Mercedes E-Class, which got 6,582 vehicle registrations. The runner-up is the BMW 5-series with 6,077 registrations, according to I4U News.As USA Today reports, California is something of an anomaly when it comes to cars. While the golden state is the largest state for auto sales in the United States, its top-selling car during the first half of 2013 was the Toyota Prius hybrid, with 33,987 cars sold. By comparison, the nation’s top-selling car, the Ford F-Series pickup truck, only sold 19,887 in California over the first six months of the year.Just last week, Tesla Motors announced that their Model S -- which costs around $60,000 -- had earned a 5-star safety rating from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), both overall and in each subcategory.As the press release states, only one percent of cars tested by the NHTSA receive a 5-star rating. Moreover, while the NHTSA does not award a rating higher than 5, the Tesla Model S received a combined 5.4 stars in the Vehicle Safety Score provided to car manufacturers.The healthy number of vehicle registrations and the 5-star rating from the NHTSA have resulted in Tesla Motors’ stock rising nearly 500% over the past year, according to Forbes.']"

It Was Supposed To Be Selling Its SP:01 By August [PHOTOS]",Angelo Young,08/26/13,11:19 AM,"[""Has Detroit Electric lost its charge?The electric car company that went under in 1938 and was revived 70 years later by former Lotus executive Albert Lam was supposed to be selling its SP:01 – an EV sports coupe unveiled in April and aimed at the same deep-pocketed EV sports car fans as the Tesla Roadster – by the end of this month, but that deadline was missed.A planned Plymouth, Mich., factory that was going to employ 180 workers by the end of the year to make a first run of 999 of these limited edition sports cars hasn't started operating.The Detroit News had this:“To further elaborate at this juncture is, unfortunately, not possible as Detroit Electric have entered into negotiations with other parties that have the potential to impact our business strategy and timing,” Don Graunstadt, head of Detroit Electric’s North America operations, said\xa0in an email to the local newspaper. “Not only are we legally bound to maintain the confidentiality of the discussions, any comment would by the nature of the situation be pure speculation due to the variables involved.”The SP:01 is based on the aluminum Lotus Elise chassis and uses a carbon fiber body like the Tesla Roaster. The Roadster was discontinued in January of last year when the Palo Alto-based maker of the Model S luxury electric sedan ran out of its supply of Lotus Elise glider kits (a glider is a frame, front axle and body). A new version of Tesla’s sports car is scheduled for production next year based on a shorter, sportier version of its Model S architecture.The SP:01 is supposed to be the first of a family of electric vehicles. Detroit Electric has a partnership with China’s Geely Automobile Group, the Hangzhou-based owner of Volvo Cars and The London Taxi Company, to make electric cars and eclectic car components for the Chinese market.Detroit Electrics claims the following specs for the SP:01 when, and if, it ever hits showrooms:Range per charge: 190 miles. Tesla claims its Roadster range is 245 miles.Acceleration: 0-62 mph in 3.7 seconds. Tesla claims 0-60 mph in 3.7 seconds for the amped up Roadster Sport.Top Speed: 155 mph. Tesla boasts 125 mph.Base price: $135,000. The Tesla Roadster started at $109,000.""]"
https://www.ibtimes.com/five-ways-tesla-motors-tsla-could-reach-100000-unit-sales-2016-1397869,"Five Ways Tesla Motors (TSLA) Could Reach 100,000 Unit Sales By 2016",Angelo Young,08/24/13,10:42 AM,"[""What a week for Tesla Motors.It started on Monday with the Palo Alto-based luxury electric sedan maker acing government crash tests for its Model S sedan. On Wednesday it announced it was taking pre-orders in China. On Thursday it announced the opening of its second manufacturing facility, this one in Tilburg, Netherlands. On Friday, Bloomberg reported that Telsa is beginning to deliver more than\xa0300 cars to customers in Hong Kong ahead of its entry to the Mainland.So it's no wonder why CEO Elon Musk told CNBC this week that he’s “tired.” Building a capital-intensive and innovative company is not easy.\xa0And it’s not going to get any easier for the founder of the critically acclaimed Model S -- history is littered with failed auto startups that began with buzzes and ended with whimpers.Musk is betting that the Tesla, essentially the Apple of the auto industry, will be able to rely on a cult-like following for those seeking a brilliantly designed product -- and that there are enough people in the world willing to pay a premium for the status that can’t be bought from the likes of a Ford Focus electric or a Toyota Prius.\xa0Musk said this week he plans to deliver 100,000 units a year by 2016, up from the 10,055 the company sold in the first half of 2013. Leaping to 100,000 units in 2016 seems ambitious, especially since its more affordable $35,000 Tesla sedan -- possibly named the Model E, a trademark the company filed earlier this month – isn’t expected to be on the market until 2017. The sexy looking Model X SUV won’t even begin production until late 2014, which means the 2016 sales goal will depend largely on S sedan growth between then and now, which will largely hinge on its success in Asia and Europe. The sales target also depends on the expansion of the U.S. network of quick-charge and battery swap stations, which encourage long-distance driving.At the same time, Musk will have to maintain the expectations of an excited market of investors. For now they’re not focused on gains, but that won't last long before they'll begin to expect real, solid profit growth based on auto sales. Some investors may even be betting on an eventual buyout from Toyota or Mercedes-Benz -- both are large investors in the company. And Musk isn’t going to be able to depend on non-GAAP manipulations to report profit, as his company did in the last quarter, or the on the revenue generated by the sale of California carbon-offset credits. At some point investors will start paying more attention to the fundamentals: Tesla’s ability to profit from selling cars at ideal margins.That will not be easy, but capital-intensive startups are not easy. Nay-saying aside, only the curmudgeonliest miser would want to see Tesla -- which is wholly devoted to low-emission, well designed, made in the U.S.A. technology -- go the way of the DeLorean.Here are five ways Tesla could avoid that fate:Get That “Gen 3” Sedan Out ASAPExpedite that $35,000 electric sedan. Musk says one will be out by 2017, which means he is aiming to deliver 100,000 luxury (electric!) cars -- the Model S and the Model X -- a year before the arrival of the cheaper sedan. A recent research note from Goldman Sachs concluded the company’s stock was overvalued. All three scenarios assume the Model S, Model X, and the so-called “Gen 3” sedan (probably the Model E) would sell at least 104,000 units by 2017. Without the Gen 3, those sales would have to come from sales in the luxury segment class. Reaching the goal of selling 100,000 cars, each with a base price of $72,000 (excluding any green car government incentives) and a fully loaded price of more than six figures, is indeed a tiring endeavor. Musk could scale up to and drop the price of his cars while maintaining expected margins, but that would be a tough task without a Tesla vehicle in the EV market that could compete against the Ford Focus electric, Nissan Leaf or other more modestly priced EVs that a wider audience of consumers could afford.Make A Tesla City CarTake a cue from Honda and make it a priority to build a small all-electric car for urban fleet sales. You can’t buy an electric Honda Fit (it can be leased), but it’s popping up in rental fleets in the U.S. While fleet sales aren’t as profitable as retail sales, they boost volume. Targeting the hipper car-sharing marketplace would raise brand awareness in urban centers. Honda has traditionally been adverse to courting fleet sales (i.e., car-rental companies) for business, believing it diminishes brand value, but it has decided to put the Fit in the hands of Zipcar and other car-share customers.Build In An Emerging Market To Lower Operating Costs Open a factory in an emerging market to help offset operating costs of assembly in California and The Netherlands. Learn from other automakers and look to Mexico, whose workers have proven to be highly skilled at auto assembly.Become The Innovator Of EV Range ExtensionTesla should take ownership of the range-concern issue and make sure to lead by example.\xa0Tesla already has broken the 200-mile psychological barrier that many believe is where customers overcome their electric-car-range anxiety. General Motors recently said it’s committed to increasing the electric-only range of its Chevrolet Volt plug-in hybrid -- already the segment leader in the hybrid electric-only range -- by 20 percent for its next generation. Tesla needs to maintain a similar pace of range extension in the electric-only market.Become The Volvo Of The 21st CenturyTesla's government crash-test record is phenomenal. It should promote this as heavily -- ASAP -- as Volvo did in the 80s. “Boxy, but good” become an informal Volvo slogan (thanks to the film “Crazy People,” starring Daryl Hannah and Dudley Moore) and it took the lead in the 90s in offering the latest in safety features. As Tesla unveils cars for the middle class, it should simultaneously build a safety-themed brand identity, similar to the one that worked so well for Volvo, to attract safety-conscious middle class families.""]"

He says his two models -- a gas drinker and a battery loader -- will become real deals within three years.“The T.25 and T.27 concept has now been sold to a customer and with a following wind a lot more drivers should be able to enjoy the center-drive experience in 2016!” Murray blogged, without providing more details. He’s a car designer, so we can presume the buyer is somehow connected to, well, making cars. (Tesla Motors Inc. [NASDAQ:TSLA], anyone?)The two vehicles would join an increasingly crowded market for city cars, such as the Fiat 500, the Daimler Smart car and the planned BMW i8. The T.25 and its electric sibling, the T.27, would be made using Murray’s iStream process, aka stabilized tube-reinforced exoframe advanced manufacturing. The process involves using low-cost composite panels that work similarly to carbon fiber to distribute the load with a strong but light frame. Early crash tests show the car is in line with city cars: In other words, you wouldn’t want to get into a collision with an SUV in one, but it meets industry standards for the vehicle’s class.Basically, what Murray has done is apply a monocoque structural approach, which employs an external skin, rather than an internal frame, to support an object’s load. The McLaren F1 was the first car to use this design principle using carbon fiber, making it the world’s fastest production car that naturally aspirates, according to the Engineer in an interview with Murray in 2011. These tiny cars are meant to be affordable, so Murray is opting out of costly carbon fiber in favor of a cheaper alternative.Whether city cars will ever be more than a retail niche that depends on urban rental-fleet sales has yet to be seen, but the eco-trend isn’t going away, nor are large cities getting any smaller and less dense.A car that takes up one-third of a standard parking spot might appeal to people who aren’t interested in long highway adventures, but want something that can carry three people and groceries from downtown to some outlying district. A Murray-designed minicar might help diminish that glorified golf-cart image.']"

Critics call Zhan a trademark troll, a pejorative used for people who rush to China’s Trade Mark Office to lay legal claim to company logos and names.At the same time, Tesla Motors has moved forward promoting its name in China as it puts the finishing touches on what will become its largest showroom, in Beijing’s Parkview Green Mall. Though Tesla is not yet commenting on the case, the showdown between Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Zhan is coming to a head because Musk has said he intends to be selling his car in China by January.The dispute will rest on whether Zhan can defend himself from accusations of so called “bad faith” trademark registration; in other words whether or not Zhan register the word “Tesla,” its Chinese equivalent, 特斯拉, Tesla’s “T” shaped badge, and Tesla’s logo (which includes the badge and the distinct font spelling out “TESLA”) with the intention of blackmailing Tesla.\xa0    These images, taken from Zhan Baosheng’s Chinese trademark office filings shows exactly what Zhan claims: The word ""Tesla,"" the Chinese equivalent, Tesla\'s badge and Tesla\'s ""Tesla Motors"" logo including the company\'s distinctive logo font. Photo: IBTimes  According to these documents, Zhan’s legal rights to the trademark are currently in “review of adjudication on opposition,” meaning that the trademark office has not yet granted Zhan the trademarks because they have been challenged, presumably by Tesla.Like most countries, excluding the U.S., Britain and former British colonies, China uses the “first to file” principle in its trademark law, which essentially means that the first person to have a trademark registration approved locally owns the rights to that trademark. That right may be challenged in court based on whether the plaintiff – in this case Tesla Motors – can prove in court that the defendant acted in bad faith by registering a trademark in order to hold it blackmail.Another factor that will affect the outcome of this dispute is whether a court can be convinced that when Zhan first applied for the Tesla trademarks back in 2006 the brand was not well known in China at the time, an important distinction in trademark law. If Zhan can assert the Tesla brand was not widely recognized in China at the time of his filing, it would bolster his case. This particular aspect of trademark law puts so-called “mid-tier” companies at a disadvantage that brands like Ford or McDonald’s don’t have because those large multinationals have heavy global brand recognition.\xa0According to the trademark office’s online database, Zhan applied for trademarks for three other companies, suggesting a pattern of trolling that Tesla could use to prove bad faith.    According to China\'s trademark authority, Zhan Baosheng has filed claims to at least three other company trademarks since 2006.  Photo: IBTimes  In 2006, Zhan filed for the Loremo trademark. Loremo was a Marl, Germany-based automaker founded in 2000 that focused on creating prototype vehicles with low weight and air resistance. By 2010 the company was inactive, citing lack of capital financing.In 2007, Zhan requested the Chinese trademark for Cobasys LLC, a supplier of nickel metal hydride batteries and battery control systems for automotive applications. The company owns more than 100 patents related to NiMH battery technology.A year later, Zhan attempted to file a trademark for Cuill, a now defunct search engine founded in 2008 by former employees of Google Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG).In addition to Zhan’s history of filing trademark registrations, he’s also a prolific claimer of domain names. He currently not only owns the URLs tesla.com.cn, teslamotors.com.cn\xa0and\xa0tesla.cn. He also owns several beauty and cosmetics-themed web addresses that all point to this site.']"

For the world’s top-earning companies, their brand name being at the forefront of the consumers’ minds is everything. In China, foreign brands are in a unique situation trying to propel their brand and name in the new market, all while toying with a different language -- and different laws.Silicon Valley luxury electric vehicle company Tesla has announced its push for the China market with the announcement of its first retail outlet in Beijing by next year. While China’s growing wealthy population is the perfect market for Tesla Motors, Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA), a branding trademark issue over the name “Tesla” could be holding them back. \xa0In China, “Tesla” is held by a Chinese man named Zhan Baosheng, also registering the web domains tesla.com.cn, teslamotors.com.cn and tesla.cn.While Tesla and Zhan battle it out over the “Tesla” name in China, some other companies had easier transitions into the Chinese market when it came to localized branding. Coca-Cola for example, is branded in China as “Ke Kou Ke Le,” a homophone for the soda brand, and also perfectly translating in Chinese to mean “tasty cola.” \xa0Some other brands also lucked out and were able to find good, phonically-similar words that also translate into something related to the company’s products or services. Viagra, a prescription drug made by Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) used mostly to treat erectile dysfunction, is sold in China as “wei ge” in Chinese, which means ""great brother,""’ an apt euphemism for the help that Viagra provides its users. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (NYSE:GS), the American investment bank, goes by “gao sheng” in China, which suitably translates to ""tall prosperity.""Unlike Tesla, another car company, Land Rover, a British subsidiary of Tata Motors Limited (BOM:500570), has found a fitting Chinese brand name with little trademark hassle. “Lu hu,” which literally translates into ‘road tiger’ is an appropriate name for the military-like sport utility vehicles. In fashion, Bottega Veneta, an Italian brand owned by French group Kering (EPA:KER) that has made a name for itself in the luxury market thanks to its leather goods, voluntarily renamed its Chinese branding from the already established ‘Bao Ti Jia’ (""fine treasure"") to the slightly different ‘Bao Die Jia’ because a Chinese businessman took the name ‘Bao Ti Jia’ by applying for a trademark before the fashion house was able to. The same thing happened to French fashion house Hermès International SCA (EPA:RMS), whose Chinese name was nabbed by a local Chinese garment company.Hugo Boss AG (FRA:BOSS), on the other hand, was able to register its Chinese brand before Chinese trademark “squatters” could get to it first. Hugo Boss has branded itself using just the latter half of the fashion label’s name, using the name “bo shi” in China. The two characters used not only sound similar to Boss’ English brand name but also translates to ""scholar,"" which elicits images of a high-class intellectual.Luckily for most foreign brands, meaningful Chinese names aren’t necessarily important to Chinese people. Brands like McDonald\'s and KFC have basically nonsense translations and still find high brand visibility among the Chinese consumer.\xa0']"

But on Thursday the same addresses pointed to a domain’s back-side index, indicating the pages were purged from the server.The domain’s index showed that August traffic to the site spiked on Wednesday, suggesting Zhan might have taken the site down amid increased scrutiny.    On Wednesday Chinese web addresses tesla.com.cn, teslamotors.com.cn and tesla.cn all pointed to a site promoting Zhan Baosheng\'s ""Tesla"" electric car website. On Thursday, the site appeared to have been taken down. The traffic report showed a spike in interest in Zhan\'s site on Wednesday. Photo: IBTimes  While Zhan does own the trademark for the world “Tesla” and the phonetic Chinese equivalent “Te Si La,” he might not have the rights in China to use Tesla’s logo, and taking down the site could be related to that. Most countries, including China, use ""first to file"" rules that grant trademark rights to, as the name implies, whomever succeeds in claiming first. However, Zhan\'s 2009 attempt to file trademark rights to Tesla\'s ""T"" logo was not approved by the Chinese patent office. Even if he was granted approval to use the logo, Tesla could challenge his use of its logo in a mainland administrative court.In November Tesla registered its wholesale company in China, called Tuo Su Le Auto Sales (Beijing) Co. Ltd. This means Tesla is probably not interested in using Zhan’s “Te Si La,” especially since it has no significant translation—when spoken the characters sound like the word “Tesla” but they don’t mean anything.It is common for companies that register names in written Chinese characters to try to match as closely as possible the phonetic equivalent of the company’s native-tongue pronunciation while at the same time using characters that translate into relevant, affirming words.""Tuo Su Le” is pronounced similarly to “Tesla” (though not as closely as “Te Si La”) and translates literally as “Expand Speed Happiness,” words any marketing executive would consider positive associations to an $80,000 luxury electric car.\xa0-Correction: An edit inserted into the original story said Tesla\'s electric sedan has two doors.

The company has said global expansion into China and Europe is an important element to meeting its goal of doubling its annual sales to 40,000 by the start of 2015.With just three more months to go before the end of the year, Tesla currently can put its trademark “Tesla Motors” only on certain types of vehicles, namely planes, trains, ships and motorized sleds,\xa0after it bought China trademark rights from trademark troll Qiao Weiwei on May 6 for an undisclosed amount of cash, according to Want China Times.

China Daily reported on Wednesday that a Tesla executive traveled to China last month to negotiate with Zhan, who has registered in China three of the most obvious website names,\xa0tesla.com.cn, teslamotors.com.cn and tesla.cn.Zhan has received a lot of heat from the Chinese public and media, who accuse him of what he’s probably doing: waiting for the kind of payout Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) had to fork over last year to win the right to use the “iPad” name from Chinese company Shenzhen Proview Technology. That deal cost Apple $60 million, down from the initial demand of $400 million from the company, according to the New York Times.Facing a barrage of criticism from the Chinese public and press, Zhan is on the defensive.Tesla could challenge him if the trademark sits idle for three years, opening way for the Chinese trademark office to revoke his rights. So he’s made public appearances using Tesla’s badge on golf carts he ostensibly produces. His Mandarin language Tesla website hints at a full-sized electric sedan, though details are scant.Zhan’s website depicts a sporty electric car beneath the Tesla logo with a trademark symbol, the word “Tesla” with a registered trademark symbol and the badge on the front of the car as well as the Chinese letters “Te Si La.”\xa0One small difference: The font of the word “Tesla” is a standard sans serif instead to Tesla’s modernist lettering, which Zhan likely doesn’t own the rights to use.\xa0\xa0[Photo of Zhan Bao Sheng on the “Tesla” golf cart from China Car Times.]\xa0']"
https://www.ibtimes.com/hyperloop-how-elon-musks-plan-will-work-pictures-1383697,Hyperloop: How Elon Musk's Plan Will Work In Pictures,Thomas Halleck,08/13/13,3:36 PM,"['Elon Musk unveiled his plan for a new form of transportation called the Hyperloop yesterday. The Hyperloop is a solar-powered alternative to planes and trains that\'s less expensive and twice as fast than any other form of land travel, Musk says, and is capable of reaching speeds of 800 miles per hour.Musk, the CEO of Tesla Motors (NASDAQ:TSLA) and founder of the private spaceflight company SpaceX, heralds the project as an alternative to California’s\xa0High-Speed Rail, a project he derides as one of the slowest and most expensive per mile in the world. The total cost of California’s current plan is roughly $68.4 billion, and Musk says his Hyperloop will cost, at most, about 11 percent of that figure ($7.5 billion). The Hyperloop will also travel over three times faster than the proposed high-speed rail, and Musk says the total cost to passengers will be about $20.The Hyperloop track described in Musk\'s proposal will travel from Los Angeles to San Francisco in about 35 minutes. He originally described it as a cross between a Concorde jet, a railgun and an air hockey table. But how does it work? Using diagrams and artist renderings of the Hyperloop, here is how Musk says the Hyperloop will function.The Hyperloop will derive the energy necessary for transport through a series of solar panels on top of the system. The solar panels, Musk says, are able to generate more power than the Hyperloop will use, thanks to an efficient design.The Hyperloop is a series of train-like pods made out of aluminum,\xa0set inside of two steel tubes -- one for each direction.\xa0The tubes are located side-by-side and\xa0Musk notes that they are constructed about 20 feet in the air, situated on top of pylons, or towers, located 100 feet apart.Musk says that the Hyperloop can be built along existing highways for minimal impact, except along sharp turns. The amount of G-force created by turning at high speeds would be too much for a person to be comfortable. So what about farmers and others who will inevitably have the a Hyperloop track in their backyard? Musk claims the Hyperloop’s pylons will be “roughly comparable to a tree or telephone pole” as opposed to the 100 feet of land necessary for the foundation of a high-speed rail.The Hyperloop’s tubes are not vacuum sealed. Musk contends that maintaining a vacuum over long distances is nearly impossible to maintain. “All it takes is one leaky seal or a small crack somewhere in the hundreds of miles of tube and the whole system stops working.”Instead, the Hyperloop will function as a “low pressure ... system set to a level where standard commercial pumps could easily overcome an air leak.” However, the air in the system creates a problem for the pod due to the resistance it creates. While the pod itself will be ""streamlined to reduce drag,"" the air between pods is still a factor. Therefore, Musk proposes a compressor fan at each end or ""nose"" of the Hyperloop\'s pods that transfers air from its front to its rear. He likens the electric fans to pumps inside of a syringe that reduce the pressure, the fans reducing each pod\'s resistance while simultaneously lifting them off of the track.The compressed air will be forced through jets on the bottom of the Hyperloop, similar to the holes on an air hockey table. These ""air bearings"" will give the Hyperloop lift, similar to how a puck levitates on an air hockey table. However, in the case of the Hyperloop, the puck (or pod) is generating the air necessary to levitate itself.But what propels the Hyperloop forward?\xa0The pods are propelled by linear induction motors, a series of magnets supplied with electric current to create a magnetic field. In a maglev train, a magnetic field is used to levitate traincars along a magnetized track. Musk says the method is too costly to be effective, and instead uses a series of induction motors spread over a long distance.Tracks of magnets located at intervals throughout the tube function as accelerators for Hyperloop. They are also known as stators, or field magnets. A long aluminum blade (called the rotor) interacts with the stator\'s magnetic field, creating a spinning force that propels the pod forward. The process is similar to how a rail gun works. Musk says the interaction will also stabilize the pod as it travels.The Hyperloop Alpha proposal is freely available online. Musk says that he decided to publishe the project ""open source,"" meaning that he will not protect the Hyperloop with patents, so that anyone can contribute to the project and any organization can its their own.\xa0Musk said he will build a small-scale, working prototype of the Hyperloop to help the project move forward, but currently has ""no plans"" to construct the project.International Business Times thanks\xa0John Gardi for his explanation of a linear induction motor. Gardi tweeted a Hyperloop plan to Elon Musk prior to his proposal of the Hyperloop, which Musk said was the best guess at the time.Follow Thomas Halleck on Twitter']"

Musk likened the idea to a pump in the head of a syringe that relieves the pressure. The ""Hyperloop Alpha,"" as it is called in the design, will also travel on air, floating just above the track to relieve friction at high speeds.The idea may sound crazy: a transportation tube capable of launching humans at supersonic speeds. Due to the tremendous amount of G-force when the Hyperloop is turning, subsonic speeds are best,\xa0Musk said, reigning in expectations for travelling from New York City to Los Angeles:“Both for trip comfort and safety, it would be best to travel at high subsonic speeds for a 350 mile journey,” Musk says, such as traveling from Los Angeles to San Francisco, for instance. “For much longer journeys, such as LA to NY, it would be worth exploring super high speeds and this is probably technically feasible, but, as mentioned above, I believe the economics would probably favor a supersonic plane.”Musk said in his proposal that the air pressure in the Hyperloop\'s tubes would be 1/6 the amount found on Mars. There are two designs in the Hyperloop Alpha concept that Musk published -- one for a passenger-only Hyperloop and another capable of carrying both people and vehicles.Update: Musk has said that the design he unveiled is a first draft, with an updated Hyperloop proposal on its way.\xa0Btw, this is not the very latest version. Will post an updated version with several late arriving corrections in a few hours.â€” Elon Musk (@elonmusk) August 12, 2013\xa0\xa0Elon Musk has a history of achieving success with things that sound crazy -- SpaceX was the first private company to successfully fire a rocket that docked with the International Space Station. Tesla Motors\' Model S was named Motor Trend\'s 2013 ""Car of the Year."" He was the basis for the Tony Stark character in the ""Iron Man"" films. If anyone is capable of achieving something that sounds like the transporter from ""Star Trek,"" it is probably Elon Musk.The Hyperloop Alpha design is ""open source"" -- meaning it is free to the public, for any entity to utilize and build. Musk has said he is too busy running Tesla and SpaceX to actually build the Hyperloop, unless no one has taken the project on for a ""few years."" If no one follows through on the Hyperloop Alpha concept it would make sense to construct it with ""Tesla involvement"", but Musk says that the idea is ""highly speculative.""Follow Thomas Halleck on Twitter']"

(NASDAQ:TSLA) might have issued a highly footnoted second-quarter earnings report on Wednesday, where it reported a profit only by including savings related to paying back a government loan nine years earlier than expected, the cash its employees put in exercising their stock options, and the $51 million the company raised selling zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) credits under a California counter-pollution program.But Wall Street brushed aside the accounting sleight-of-hand, sending the company’s stock price to a record high on Thursday. One major reason for that is Tesla sales growth. The automaker said this week it sold 5 percent more cars in the second quarter than it did in the first three months of the year, to 5,150.That sales rise means that the estimated 4,750 units for the first quarter was too low. A 5 percent rise to 5,150 would mean the company sold 4,905 cars in the first three months of the year and 10,055 units in the first half, putting it well on its way to meeting the 20,000 target for 2013.It also means that the Model S luxury electric sedan is the second-best selling all-electric vehicle in the U.S. after the Nissan Leaf, the five-door hatchback that rattled the green-machine market when the 2013 model came in at a starting base price of under $30,000, becoming the cheapest electric vehicle in America.\xa0The price, plus Nissan’s aggressive incentive program, has sent sales of the Leaf to 11,703 from January to July. \xa0Tesla’s Model S, with a starting price around $70,000 and a range above 200 miles (compared to less than 100 miles for the Leaf), is catching up fast despite its steep sticker price.The other electric vehicles in the market aren’t even close, according to company sales figures.

The Mitsubishi i-MiEV U.S. unit sales stands at 928 for the year to July while the all-electric Honda Fit has sold only 328 units.Considering the ongoing anxiety over limited range, this doesn’t bode well for the performance of two models that have been released into the U.S. market since May – the Smart Fortwo EV from Mercedez-Benz and the Fiat 500e.']"

CEO Elon Musk (not seen) demonstrate Tesla's new battery-swapping program in Hawthorne, Calif., June 20, 2013.Tesla Motors Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), the little American electric car company that could, released second-quarter earnings on Wednesday with more footnotes per page than a David Foster Wallace novel.While nobody expects the maker of the critically acclaimed Model S electric luxury sedan to offer big returns on investment anytime soon – after all, it’s a startup in a highly capital-intensive industry with a high historic failure rate – Tesla’s chairman and CEO Elon Musk is under intense pressure to maintain momentum, and part of that includes utilizing some perfectly legal accounting maneuvers.“Tesla Shocks Everyone And Reports Surprise Profit,” the popular auto blog Jalopnik gushed on Wednesday afternoon.“The auto maker, led by founder Elon Musk, reported net income of $26.3 million, excluding one-time items, that handily beat expectations for a loss of $18.9 million,” reported USA Today.The truth is somewhere in-between. As USA Today suggests, there were one-time items that brought the company income, most of which will never be seen again. There’s also income that under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) would not have been as high as Tesla reported this quarter.Tesla states very clearly at the start of its letter to shareholders that it is offering two perspectives on its performance in the last quarter ending June 30.“In this letter and going forward, we will report our results on a GAAP basis as well as on a non-GAAP basis,” the letter states. “We believe these non-GAAP financials are useful as they align with the underlying cash-flow activity and timing of vehicle deliveries, and because we use such information internally for operational management and financial planning purposes.” \xa0So how did Tesla turn a loss of $30.5 million into a $26.3 million profit?\xa0By including one-time gains and one non-GAAP item. Excluding the one non-GAAP item, the company still turned a profit of about $7 million, but only because its own employees gave it money by exercising stock options. (And this doesn't even address the $51 million Tesla made in the second quarter selling zero emission vehicle credits provided by the state of California.)Here’s the breakdown of the four items:    Tesla's second quarter earnings report included four items that turned a $30.5 million loss into a $26.3 million gain. Photo: IBTimes  1. Thanks to its partnership with U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) and Wells Fargo & Co. (NYSE:WFC), which includes guarantees on the resale value of the Model S, Tesla is getting all of the money upfront for three-year leases. Instead of customers paying Telsa on a regular basis, and then Tesla reporting that income quarterly like auto companies typically do, Tesla received the total sum of these leases in one go from the banks.As long as Telsa can continue to grow its financing business and has backers willing to provide the income for the life of the leases, the company will be able to continue to report this as quarterly income. If that income had been spread out according to GAAP standards, it would have been about $1.6 million in the second quarter instead of $19.3 million.2. Tesla earned income in the second quarter on stock-based compensation income. In other words, Tesla paid employees in stock options and then the employees exercised those options. In the first half of the year, Tesla garnered $34.1 million in income from its own employees, up from $23.2 million in the first half of last year.The Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University described stock-based compensation as “one of the most enduring controversies in accounting.”“In a nutshell, managers seem to be more motivated by hitting benchmarks, making their numbers look better,” Ian Gow, assistant professor of business administration at Harvard Business School, said in a research paper in 2011. Before 2006, GAAP standards would have excluded most stock options as income. Tesla reported $19.3 million in the second quarter from its own employees’ stock options.3. Tesla paid off its U.S. Department of Energy loan nine years early in the past quarter, incurring a fee of $11 million for paying ahead. But it also calculated $16.4 million in income from early loan repayment. This income is clearly an unorganic one-time item.4. Tesla also made a modest $1.8 million on non-cash interest related to convertible notes.With these four items, Tesla turned a loss into a gain, but only the leasing deal has anything to do with the organic profit of Tesla, the only one pertaining to making and selling cars.Not that it matters. The company’s stock price reached an all-time high of $157.86 on Wednesday. Apparently some investors didn't pay attention to the footnotes.\xa0""]"

Technical Breakdown Shows Elon Musk's Project Is Possible",Ryan W. Neal,08/07/13,2:03 PM,"[""Tesla Motors Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk dropped mysterious hints throughout July about “The Hyperloop,” a new high-speed transportation system that he says will take riders from Los Angeles to San Francisco in under 20 minutes and cost one-tenth of the price of the proposed bullet train from L.A. to S.F. Musk announced that he would reveal the plans by Aug. 12, but that didn’t stop designers from creating mockups predicting how the Hyperloop technology could work.John Gardi, a “tinkerer and jack-of-all-trades currently living in Canada,” according to Motherboard, designed a mockup of the Hyperloop that Musk praised for being the “best guess” he’d seen yet. Gardi elaborated on his Hyperloop design, which Musk describes as a cross between a Concorde\xa0supersonic plane, a rail gun and an air hockey table, to give an idea of the technology needed to actually build a Hyperloop, and how it would actually be a cost-effective project.Using some clues from Musk, Gardi determined that each Hyperloop car would be roughly the same size and weight as a family car. He extrapolated from this the maximum weight the Hyperloop’s main structure could support. Gardi concludes that because a high-speed rail car would be nearly 20 times heavier, the construction of the Hyperloop would be cheaper and the components would be stronger.@John_Gardi your guess is the closest I've seen anyone guess so far. Pod diameter probably around 2mâ€” Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 15, 2013\xa0Gardi says this difference in weight will make it possible for the Hyperloop to be an elevated structure, which will ultimately reduce costs by avoiding the pitfalls of ground-level rail. It will be easier for the Hyperloop to avoid both manmade and natural obstacles, and completely avoid digging tunnels. It could also lease out farmland and make contracts with communications companies like Google that might be interested in using the structure to expand fiber optic cables.With that in mind, Gardi proposed a Hyperloop that consists of concrete footings set into the ground every 300 feet, with pylons on top that range from 40 feet to 100 feet tall. Nine-foot wide and 300-foot tall trusses will span the top of the pylon to support the tube sections, which will be roughly 18 feet wide and 9 feet tall.To minimize the weight of the Hyperloop, Gardi suggested composite sewer pipe. It’s inexpensive, already produced in the right size and can handle far more weight than necessary for the Hyperloop.Finally, Gardi even explores how Musk’s company could go about constructing the Hyperloop. The first step would be the footings and the pylons. After the first truss is placed on top of two pylons it can be used as a platform to construct the rest of the Hyperloop using a crane.“The speed of laying trusses is limited only by the speed of the crane and the efficiency of the supply chain,” Gardi wrote in Motherboard. “By adding an extra component to the overall design, we’d save money over the entire project and not just construction phase either! Those trusses would more than pay for themselves by an order of magnitude compared to any other construction method!”Tesla Motors, Musk’s electronic car company, will report its earnings\xa0after markets close Wednesday. Analysts expect the company to report $18.8 million, or 17 cents per share, on $383 million in revenue.What do you think of Gardi’s prediction on the construction of the Hyperloop? Will it make Musk’s claims of high-speed, low-cost transportation possible? Let us know in the comments section.\xa0""]"

Model X[UPDATE 4:30 p.m. EDT] Tesla missed profit expectations, losing more than expected, but it generated more revenue and wider margins than forecasted. It also sold more cars, sending the stock price up in after-market trading.\xa0Click here for the results.\xa0Original story begins here:\xa0Tesla is cutting its losses, literally.The Palo Alto, Calif.-based maker of the acclaimed Model S luxury electric car is expected to report a smaller loss in its second quarter ending June 30 after spending heavily last year to streamline its production and boost sales.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters see Tesla Motors Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) losing $18.8 million, or 17 cents per share, on $383 million in revenue when it reports its earnings after markets close on Wednesday. \xa0The company founded by inventor and entrepreneur Elon Musk a decade ago reported its first quarterly profit after taxes, of $11.2 million, in the first three months of this year, thanks in part to $68 million in revenue generated from the sale of carbon credits under California’s compliance offset program.But despite falling back into the red, Tesla has narrowed its losses from the same quarter last year, when it lost $79 million on a meager $30 million in revenue. The company said it sold about 4,750 Model S sedans in the first quarter and has said it would reach a milestone of more than 20,000 unit sales by the end of the year.“Everything Tesla has accomplished in the past six months – getting their NUMMI plant [Tesla’s Fremont, Calif.-based manufacturing facility] up to speed and paying off their government loans early – suggests they are capable of sustained growth versus flash-in-the-pan results we’ve seen from other electric car makers in recent years,” Karl Brauer, senior analyst at automotive vehicle valuation company Kelley Blue Book, told International Business Times.What should investors look for in today’s earnings report? Tesla doesn’t report monthly sales figures like other automakers do, so look for guidance on second-quarter and future sales volume. Musk told The Detroit News in an interview last month that his company is churning out 400 cars per week to fulfill U.S. orders, a rate necessary for the company to meet its goal of selling at least 20,000 cars by the end of the year. The key to Tesla’s long-term success will be maintaining and then quickly boosting that production rate. The introduction of the\xa0Model X mid-sized crossover next year should help.Also look for gross margin — how much the company makes on the sale of each car — which Tesla says will hit 25 percent by the end of the year. Analysts estimate margins will increase in the second quarter by 1.4 percentage points to 18.8 percent, largely thanks to an increase in the price of options. Tesla’s target consumers – buyers of pricey luxury cars – are thought to be less likely to balk at price increases for add-ons, and it allows the company to expand margins without changing the starting price of about $71,000 for the 60kWh base Model S. Recent price increases include $1,000 more for the panoramic roof. The recent margin-expanding adjustments to the numerous options has led to some backlash on Tesla's Forum website.The company plans to double its production rate by the end of next year as it embarks on global expansion. The Model S recently went on sale in Europe and is on its way to China, the world’s largest auto market with a rapidly expanding base of luxury-auto buyers, where a showroom is expected to be opened in Beijing’s tony Parkview Green Mall before the end of December. Any indication of an increase in weekly output will be welcomed by Tesla bulls because it would suggest the company will hit or exceed expected sales volume for the year.The company’s stock price spiked 183 percent in the second quarter, topping $100 toward the end of May after it announced it paid off its $451.8 million Department of Energy loan nine years ahead of schedule. Investors had other reasons to cheer over the past quarter – namely the announcement of an aggressive expansion of Tesla's supercharger network and the unveiling of its quick-swap battery system.Regarding those carbon credits that helped Tesla post its first profit in the first quarter: The California Air Resources Board could decide later this year to cut off bonus credits Tesla has been receiving for committing to a way to offer quick refueling with its 90-second battery-swap system.Dave Clegern, a CARB spokesman, told IBTimes that the change isn’t directed at Tesla but rather to prevent companies from collecting credits on technology they have yet to implement.“There are potentially other companies and manufacturers that could come forward asking for carbon credits for technology they haven’t yet implemented that they might not implement,” Clegern told IBTimes. “The reason why Tesla came through was because they showed enough progress in the technology, and we didn’t have grounds to deny their request. However, if you look at what they’re doing – building these supercharger networks – they’re obviously in it for the long run. They’re not doing his just to get some credits from CARB. They’re doing it to sell cars.”The change to the CARB bonus-credit loophole, however, will reduce Tesla’s revenue from the sale of carbon credit offsets. How this will affect the company’s ability to turn a small profit in the fourth quarter, as analysts and the company both expect, will probably be revealed some time in the third quarter. \xa0The eventful second quarter has rocketed the company’s stock price, and opinions seem significantly divided on just how much Tesla is worth right now, considering that it was trading below $40 just four months ago.“I think the exuberance for Tesla is over the top. There’s probably a lot of speculation going on, people hoping that they’ll get bought,” Michelle Krebs, senior analyst for automotive pricing and information provider Edmunds.com, told IBTimes in an interview last month after a Goldman Sachs auto industry report suggested the company’s stock was overpriced.“There’s always been the thinking that since Toyota is an investor they would eventually swallow it up,” she added. “Or, because Daimler is an investor, they would eventually swallow it up. It’s a little overheated. The electric car business is limited and Tesla has one expensive model right now.”In 2009, Daimler AG (FRA:DAI), the German maker of Mercedes-Benz and Smart cars, bought 10 percent of Tesla for $50 million about a year before it went public. Toyota Motor Corporation (TYO:7203), the world’s top auto company by sales volume, bought $50 million in Tesla shares when the company went public in July 2010 and the stock was worth about $20 a share. The company’s stock price closed Tuesday at $142.15.The Goldman Sachs report by auto analyst Patrick Archambault said Tesla’s stock should be worth between $58 and $113 per share – depending on three scenarios of future sales volume of up to 250,000 units per year by 2018. The news shaved more than 14 percent off Tesla’s stock on July 16.But then two days later Dougherty & Co. analyst Andrea James helped boost the rebound in stock price by suggesting Tesla would be headed to $200 a share based on an assumption that it would “eventually” sell up to 500,000 units a year at a 25 percent margin. (See the full interview with James on Bloomberg TV here.)Whether Tesla is the future of luxury electric cars or an experiment destined to fail — history is littered with failed automotive startups — is a story that's yet to be completed. But the story so far has gotten lot more interesting in recent months.""]"

(NYSE:F) and Chrysler Group LLC have been weak players in sedans for decades, relying largely on sales of pickup trucks and SUVs, which have much higher profit margins than regular passenger cars. But in recent years Ford and GM have strengthened their product mix in this category.The news should give a boost to Impala sales, helping GM, which has not done as well as Ford in the sedan segment. Sales of the 2014 Impala were down in June compared to the previous model in the same month last year, but the latest praise should help see sales rise.“With GM we know they’re having some challenges with sedans. Ford has outstripped GM in their efforts to become competitive in a segment that has been traditionally dominated by the Japanese,” said Alec Gutierrez, senior market analyst for automotive pricing company Kelley Blue Book, in an interview earlier this week regarding Ford and GM earnings. “Ford has been receiving a lot of glowing reviews for its Fusion, Escape and Focus.”Starting at $26,725, the Impala beat out comparable rivals like the latest Ford Taurus, Dodge Charger and Toyota Avalon.“Consumer Reports’ engineers found the Impala rides like a luxury sedan, with a cushy and controlled demeanor, while delivering surprisingly agile handling, capable acceleration and excellent braking,” said the consumer-products testing magazine.Consumer Reports gave the vehicle an overall rating of 95, the highest for a sedan. It earned high marks for solid handling, spacious interior cabin design and intuitive controls. Only the Model S hatchback from Tesla Motors Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) and the 1-Series coupe from Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (FRA:BMW) have earned higher ratings.“The 2014 Impala is like a scarred and once-proud prizefighter who has been down on his luck but now re-enters the ring eyeing a big comeback, and it’s Chevy’s newest attraction,” said a recent review in Car & Driver magazine.']"

CEO Elon Musk (not seen) demonstrate Tesla's new battery-swapping program in Hawthorne, Calif., June 20, 2013.General Motors Co. (NYSE:GM) CEO Dan Akerson has not minced words about his disdain for the way GM was run until its Chapter 11 reorganization in June 2009.Now he’s starting to pay more attention to Silicon Valley startup Tesla Motors Inc. (Nasdaq:TSLA), a sign that North America’s largest automaker is acknowledging what Tesla Chairman and CEO Elon Musk is up to on the West Coast.Akerson has created a small team devoted to studying Tesla to determine threats the upstart manufacturer may pose to the Detroit auto giant while it tries to boost innovation with more patents, high-speed wireless connectivity in future vehicle design, and develop a next-generation Chevrolet Volt plug-in electric despite lackluster sales.Akerson and GM want to be sure that Tesla doesn't leave it behind in the field of automobile innovation.“In the old days, they would’ve said, ‘It’s a bunch of laptop batteries and don’t worry about it and blah, blah, blah,’” Steve Girsky, GM vice chairman, told Bloomberg in a report published Thursday, referring to how GM executives initially reacted to Tesla’s electric drive system. \xa0That attitude is gone under Akerson, says Grisky, and GM higher ups are taking heed. Tesla’s Model S has won high praise not just because it’s pushing electric plug-in engines powered by a cluster of lithium-ion batteries as the future. If you remove the battery power and plop in a clean diesel engine, the car would still keep its accolades for design. And Tesla has wholly embraced the latest mobile technology as an integral part of the vehicle, including a 17-inch touch-screen dashboard control and Internet connectivity. In the first quarter the Model S outsold GM’s Volt for the first time, which helped in the wake-up call.Tesla has only turned a profit in one quarter since it was founded in 2003, and that was thanks to selling off its carbon-offset credits. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect the company to see profit again in the fourth quarter – but that could change.Investors Shrug Off Goldman Sachs Warning On Tesla Stock PriceOn Tuesday, a Goldman Sachs report suggested that the company’s stock price was overheated and could decline to between $84 and $113, depending on the rate of sales volume. The price touched a record $133 a share on Monday, but lost 20 percent between Tuesday and Wednesday morning after the research note went public. \xa0But on Wednesday the stock rebounded as investors bought on the price slump and also because an analyst at Dougherty & Co raised her price target from $90 a share to $200.So far the stock has rebounded 12 percent since the drop. It was trading at $120.25 near the opening bell in New York on Thursday, suggesting that investors are shrugging off the Goldman Sachs projection.Goldman Sachs says the company needs to be on track to sell at least 105,000 units by 2018 to justify an $84 share price by the end of the year, and that it needs a sales volume trajectory toward 250,000 units by 2018 to justify a share price of $113 by December.Tesla sold 4,900 sedans in the first quarter, and Musk says he expects to sell about 21,000 units this year. The company will issue its second-quarter earnings results after markets close on Aug. 7. That will offer a glimpse into the company’s progress toward the 2013 sales goal.\xa0""]"

Reacting to the comments, investors on Tuesday dumped shares, pushing the price down 14.3 percent to $109.10.Goldman Sachs’ commentary reflects just how volatile Tesla’s stock has become as it has rocketed more than 275 percent in value from the start of the year. On Friday\xa0 a share of Tesla became pricier than a share of Toyota Motor Corp. (NYSE:TM), the world's largest automaker by sales volume.Goldman Sachs analyst Patrick Archambault is saying Tesla’s stock should be approaching $58 to $113 per share based on three different sedan sales volume scenarios: one high, one low, and one in between. Archambault’s most bearish scenario in his note has Tesla eventually selling 105,000 total units a year by 2018; his most bullish scenario is 250,000 units.The company’s stock price has been on a tear since it reported its first-ever profit in the first quarter, jumping high from its low $40s in April, soaring on Tesla’s recent announcements to dramatically expand its proprietary supercharger network and to offer a rapid battery-swap system to address consumers’ electric-car range anxiety.“This is more of a correction than anything else,” said Alec Gutierrez, senior market analyst for automotive valuation company Kelley Blue Book. “There might have been a little too much exuberance after they revealed the supercharger network and the battery swap, and especially after they announced beating Volt in the first quarter.”Tesla’s Model S outsold both the Chevrolet Volt and the Nissan Leaf, two top selling electric models, in the first three months of the year with about 4,900 units.Tesla fans are swooning at the recent developments, and even the skeptics of luxury electric cars are following Tesla closely to see whether their views are vindicated by Tesla’s failure or impugned by its success.The movement of stock often reflects little more than gambling on emotions and hype, and hype is something Tesla Chairman and CEO Elon Musk, the South Africa-born founder of e-payment service Paypal and space transport company SpaceX, seems to be particularly good at creating -- most recently with his talk about unveiling open-source plans for a hypothetical 700 mph “Hyperloop” transport network between Los Angeles and San Francisco.But the momentum for a company’s success isn’t its stock value. What really counts is how many Tesla sedans roll off the assembly line and into driveways and garages. Tesla says it expects to sell about 21,000 units this year, with sales expanding to Europe and Asia before 2014.The company will issue its second-quarter earnings results after markets close on Aug. 7. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect a 15 cent loss on earnings per share and $18 million in losses on $402 million in revenue. The company is currently expected by these analysts to report its second quarterly profit since it went public in July 2010 in the fourth quarter of 2013, after it eked into profitability in the first quarter thanks to selling its carbon credits.""]"

Musk told PandoDaily that the Hyperloop will “never crash, is immune to weather, it goes 3 or 4 times faster than the bullet train.”Here is a look at five different aspects of the past, present and future of alternative transport systems in an attempt to uncover just where Musk might be headed.1.) 1870, The Beach Pneumatic Subway, New York CityAlfred Ely Beach began construction on a pneumatic subway line in New York City beneath Broadway in 1869. His “Beach Pneumatic Transit Company” completed the project the following year, running a single car on a track from Warren Street to Murray Street to demonstrate a pneumatic transit system and donating all proceeds from the project to charity.In a pneumatic tube, capsules are transported through a tube network through a vacuum or pushed by compressed air. NYC’s Pneumatic Subway utilized a 50 ton fan that blew the car through the subway tunnel, with the blades reversing course to bring the car back. The Hyperloop will operate above ground, but Beach\'s pneumatic subway shows just how long mankind has looked for new and alternative modes of transport. Joseph Brennan, an engineer working for Columbia University, wrote an in-depth piece about Beach Pneumatic that you can access here.2.) 2274 - Logan’s Run, Washington, D.C. \xa0In the 1976 film “Logan’s Run,” the title character utilizes a pod car that traverses a series of tubes to travel around the dystopian domed city where everyone lives (until their 30th birthday, that is). Since the “Bullet Train” http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinkansen has a high speed of about 149-199 mph, the Hyperloop will shoot for about 750-1,000 mph, and therefore be much faster than the “Logan’s Run” pod cars.3.) 2999 - “Futurama” Tube Transport System, New York CityThe New York City envisioned by the animated television show “Futurama” has replaced its underground subway with a Tube Transport System. The tubes look pneumatic, but how they function is not explained in the show. Like the Tube Transport System, Hyperloop will likely be enclosed, since Musk said that it will not be affected by weather.4.) Evacuated Tube Transport Technologies (ET3)The ET3 is a patent for a possible technology where passenger capsules the size of a normal car travel along a magnetically levitated track\xa0through an air-locked tube. The Los Angeles Times\xa0reported that\xa0Musk has said the Hyperloop will not function exactly as a maglev through a vacuum tube, like ET3 does.5.) 2013 – Tesla Supercharger Network, Tesla Motors, Fremont, Calif.Tesla founder Elon Muska said that the Hyperloop could power itself “if you put solar panels on it” because doing so would “generate more power than you would consume in the system.” The solar technology developed at Tesla Motors for the company’s Supercharger Network would be a likely candidate for powering the Hyperloop.As Elon Musk has said, “There is a way to store the power so it would run 24/7 without using batteries. Yes, this is possible, absolutely.”Follow Thomas Halleck on Twitter']"

(NASDAQ:TSLA) design studio in Hawthorne, Calif., Tuesday night, Tesla CEO Elon Musk attempted to dispel doubts that electric cars will never be as convenient as traditional gas-guzzlers. Musk unveiled a battery-swap system that will give a Tesla Model S a complete charge in just 90 seconds.That battery-swap demonstration took place on stage while a video showed a Tesla employee filling a gas tank. Musk assured the crowd that Tesla searched for the gas station in Los Angeles with the fastest fill-rate (10 gallons per minute) and told the demonstrator to fill the tank as fast as he could.Fast Pack Swap Event from Tesla Motors on Vimeo.It took more than four minutes to fill the 23-gallon gas tank, which gave Musk time to demonstrate the Model S battery-swap service twice, with time left over to crack jokes about how he was boring the audience. The new battery-swap service is certainly an upgrade from the 20 minutes to an hour it takes to charge a Model S using the current Tesla “supercharging” stations.The battery-swap service stations will be added to the network of supercharging stations Tesla is building around the nation. The supercharging will remain free, but the 90-second battery swap will cost between $50 and $80.

Tesla says it will make necessary arrangements and that owners need not take their cars to service centers.\xa0']"

(NASDAQ:TSLA), tweeted today:How could Tesla offer this service? Presumably the swap of the 990-pound pack of lithium ion batteries would take less than the approximately 20 minutes it takes to recharge the vehicle. Would the battery swaps be available at every one of the company’s rapidly multiplying recharge stations? Would the service be offered at every Tesla recharging station?The technology was always part of Tesla’s plan -- from the start, the battery pack was made to be swappable, like a gigantic mobile phone battery. But obvious logistical issues have to be worked out.Basically Tesla is taking on the task that electric-vehicle infrastructure builder Better Place initially started. Better Place, based in Palo Alto, Calif., but with primary operations in Israel, fell into Israeli bankruptcy court in May after failing to gauge how long it would take for the market to embrace electric vehicles. Furthermore, Tesla is one of the few automakers with a car that has swappable batteries. The company will post a battery swap demo on its website at 9:30 p.m. PDT.""]"

The company’s Tesla Model S was named the 2013 Motor Trend Car of the Year, and, after paying off its federal loans nine years early, Tesla\'s\xa0stock is soaring.The fiery industrialist also speaks his mind freely, often engaging in Twitter feuds with critics, so we can only imagine what the self-described workaholic\xa0will discuss at D11. Will Musk discuss his proposed “affordable” Tesla model for under $40,000? He has previously said the car would not likely be ready until 2017.Musk has\xa0told Businessweek he was concerned with large-scale problems -- that humanity has no sustainable energy source and that “we are not a multiplanetary species.” His proposed Hyperloop device is a theoretical ultra-high-speed transportation mode and alternative to the plane, train and automobile that, as Elon Musk describes it, sounds like something out of ""Star Trek."" Speaking of sci-fi, filmmaker Jon Favreau said that Musk was an inspiration behind his depiction of billionaire genius Tony Stark,\xa0and Musk himself had a cameo in the 2010 ""Iron Man"" sequel.Musk said that his proposed transportation device, the Hyperloop, would be solar-powered, faster than a plane and that passengers would not need a “specific departure time.” Perhaps he will elaborate on his plans for the device, not having discussed it in depth since last year.Musk tweeted an article on Monday about how Governor Rick Perry signed a bill legalizing the temporary closure of Texas beaches for rocket launches. The bill is anticipating a commercial launch facility that SpaceX is considering building in Cameron County, Texas. SpaceX is also considering sites in Georgia, Florida and Puerto Rico. Will he make an announcement regarding the space transport and tourism company?

Ranieri responded\xa0in a release that the information in the tweet was “unmistakably correct,” noting that Chrysler had repaid its loans two years ago.Musk retorted\xa0by noting that since Chrysler is controlled by Fiat of Italy, it is not an American car company.

(Nasdaq:TSLA) surged about 32 percent to about $74 by Thursday afternoon, fueled by its first profits posted in yesterday's earnings report and a glowing review from Consumer Reports.The magazine gave Tesla's luxury electric sedan its highest score, a 99 out of 100. Only the Lexus LS has garnered the same score.“There, we said it,” the review read. “The Tesla Model S outscores every other car in our test Ratings. It does so even though it’s an electric car. In fact, it does so because it is electric.”The only thing that held Musk’s flagship automobile back from the coveted “Recommended Buy” – and completely acing the review – was a lack of serious road-time.“Despite its stratospheric road-test score, we can’t recommend the Model S until we have sufficient reliability data,” Consumer Reports said.And according to Jalopnik, the car would have received above a perfect score were it not for the “limitations still inherent in owning an electric car.”The Palo Alto-based automaker began selling the car -- which begins at $69,900 and can cost as much $89,650 – last summer and sales have increased steadily.The Model S was the subject of quite the media stir in February after a negative road test review in the New York Times prompted a furious series of retorts from Musk.The Times’ own public editor, Margaret Sullivan, later found the reporter, John M. Broder, erred as he drove the car up the East Coast, eventually stalling out. Musk’s own analytics later revealed that Broder had not charged the car according to its guidelines. \xa0For its part, Consumer Reports said the car’s 85-kWh lithium-ion battery consistently lasted about 200 miles, as is advertised, running from a cold-weather low of 180 miles to a warm-weather high of 225.""]"

The Tesla Model X prototype electric SUV is one of the more fascinating electric vehicles showing at the 2013 North American International Auto Show in Detroit.  Photo: IBTimes/Angelo Young  The X, which Silicon Alley-based Tesla Motors Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) says will begin production next year at its assembly plant in Fremont, Calif., seats seven adults in three rows powered by a dual-electric motor all-wheel drive. The massive lithium ion battery – available in 60 KwH for 230 miles of range or the 85 kWh for a travel distance of 300 miles – is distributed along the floor of the vehicle, which means the front where a traditional engine would be located is freed up for storage. The gull-wing doors are more than an artifice; when open they allow passengers to stand completely up in the center row improving interior mobility for removing groceries or setting up a child seat.    Tesla's Model X prototype electric SUV is scheduled to go into production in Fremont, Calif., next year.  Photo: IBTimes/Angelo Young  Whether the X or any other electric vehicle will be something average car owners with average incomes would consider buying, especially outside of densely populated urban zones, depends on three factors: range, cost and infrastructure. None of these have been resolved in any capacity that would make electric vehicles competitors to regular gas burners or hybrids.    The Tesla Model X prototype electric SUV has a 17-inch iPad-like interface.  Photo: IBTimes/Angelo Young  Tesla has been losing money – a billion dollars as of last summer as it engages in the capital intensive effort to set up manufacturing and marketing – and it won’t yet disclose how well sales are going for its Model S sedan that began deliveries last June. Despite having just won the 2013 Motor Trends Car of the Year, sales performance of the American-innovated, -designed and -manufactured beauty will be a harbinger of whether the company will be able to move forward successfully with the X.    The red Tesla Model S electric luxury sedan showing at the 2013 Detroit Auto Show has a nearly-six-figure sticker price, including the federal tax credit.  Photo: IBTimes/Angelo Young  Charging a Tesla, or any other electric vehicle, effectively requires the 240-volt station that comes with most electric vehicles. These domestic charges can fill up a Tesla overnight. The company has built six so-called Superchargers stations that allow trips between Los Angeles and San Francisco, a one-way distance of 420 miles, as well as spurs that allow drivers to recharge their way to Lake Tahoe and Las Vegas. The company says these stations can give a 50 percent charge in 30 minutes.None of this is enough to sustain a car company, and for electric vehicles to truly take hold in America or any other country, charging points will need to be as ubiquitous as gas stations. The price of the Model S starts at $52,400 including the $7,500 federal tax incentive aimed at encouraging consumers to go green. But that’s a starting-level battery with a range of 160 miles. The price of the Model X isn't likely to be much less, and could be higher. The Model S Performance vehicle showing in Detroit had a sticker price of over $99,000.    The massive lithium ion battery that powers Tesla vehicles runs along the floor, leaving the space for a traditional engine free for storage.  Photo: IBTimes/Angelo Young  Tesla can make wonderful and environmentally friendly Made-in-the-USA cars, but if the prices don’t come down, if the battery technology isn’t extended, and, most important, if the country doesn’t put the pedal to the metal to expand the number of places the batteries can be re-charged so that owners aren’t rushing home to plug in, then Tesla will either find a niche among the world’s environmentally friendly luxury car buyers, or end up in the history books as an early but unsuccessful American innovator.\xa0The North American International Auto Show opens to the public on Thursday and runs through Jan. 27.""]"

The stores act as locations where potential buyers can see Tesla’s cars, test drive and configure their cars. Telsa will have 24 retail locations in North America and 34 globally following the addition of the new stores this fall. The new stores will be located in the Boston and Chicago metropolitan areas; Paramus and Morristown, N.J.; San Diego and Topanga, Calif.; Miami Beach, Fla.; and McLean, Va.; as well as the company’s first Canadian location in Toronto.“As we open locations throughout the country, our approach continues to be geared toward engaging and informing more people about Tesla and Model S and the technology behind it,” Blankenship said.

(NYSE: ROC), according to a Standard & Poor\'s Capital IQ report Friday.""The future for lithium and lithium mining looks very positive, assuming a secular trend toward increasing electric vehicle production takes hold,"" S&P Capital IQ Diversified Metals & Mining Equity Analyst Leo Larkin said.Lithium is a key ingredient in industrial products including glass, batteries and lubricating greases, according to the report. In recent years, lithium use expanded rapidly as consumer electronics like mp3 players, laptops and cell phones came to increasingly rely on lithium-ion batteries. Global lithium demand has tripled over the past decade, and the global market price of lithium carbonate has likewise tripled since 2001 to its current level of around $6,000 per ton.""The lithium-ion \'Li-ion\' battery business ... is growing very rapidly to many tens of billions of dollars yearly, thanks to billions of dollars continuing to be invested in the industry,"" a Friday report by Research And Markets said, citing expanded use of lithium-ion batteries beyond consumer electronics. Future growth in the lithium-ion battery market will be primarily driven by demand for ""hybrid electric vehicles by land, water and air.""Moreover, an industrial research report by David & Company predicts that the global market for lithium-ion batteries will balloon to $43 billion by 2020, compared to a 2010 level of just $11 billion, with the primary driver being increased demand for electric cars. The S&P report also cites research from exploration company Ultra Lithium saying that the growth in demand for electric cars is ""the real cause of the interest in the market and the potential for growth of lithium demand."" The price of lithium has increased 10 percent in 2011 alone.Tesla Motors Inc.

Production for the company is expected to ramp up substantially following release of the Model S in June at the beginning of the third quarter. The company is also working to bring a crossover, the Model X, to market at the end of 2013.Because Tesla was not actively selling cars during the second quarter, revenue from sales was essentially non-existent. Morgan Stanley research published on July 16 predicted that the company burned through $132 million in the second quarter. Money drawn from a U.S. Department of Energy loan could push the total cash drain up to $235 million for the quarter. R&D expenditures for the company sky-rocketed 56.2 percent to $82 million. Selling, general and administrative expenses are predicted to rise 37.6 percent to $34 million.I am amazed at how fast our robots can position major sections of the car and how quickly our massive presses can transform huge rolls of aluminum into doors, hoods and battery enclosures, Tesla Motors vice president worldwide sales and ownership experience wrote in May.Tesla also announced it was opening four new U.S. stores, the first of which in Westchester, New York, opened in May with four Model S beta cars.

The new electric RAV4 will have a range of approximately 100 miles with a charging time of roughly six hours, but the $49,800 MSRP price tag could scare off some potential buyers.Toyota is hoping buyers will be electrified by the fact that the RAV4 EV is the only all-electric SUV on the market and that Elon Musk's brainchild Tesla Motors Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) helped with its development, but the company does not seem to expect RAV4 EV sales to move at lightning speed, or even at a tortoise's pace, as it is only planning on selling 2,600 over the next three years.In contrast, Toyota sold 15,196 conventional RAV4s in the month of April alone. The standard RAV4 only costs $22,650 MSRP, less than half the cost of the RAV4 EV. What's more, the RAV4 EV will initially only be available in four metro areas in California when it goes on sale this summer: Sacramento, the San Francisco Bay Area, Los Angeles/Orange County and San Diego.The high price tag compared to the standard RAV4, which gets 22 mpg city, 28 mpg highway, and low availability of the new RAV4 EV could contribute to Toyota's very modest sales goal for the car.We believe that the RAV4 EV will attract sophisticated early technology adopters, much like the first-generation Prius. It's designed for consumers who prioritize the environment and appreciate performance, \xa0said Bob Carter, Toyota Motor Sales USA group vice president and general manager of Toyota Division. We look forward to seeing how the market responds.Its lackluster sales goals aside, the engineering that went into creating the RAV4 EV was successful. Tesla, better known for the Tesla Roadster and the forthcoming Model X cross-over SUV, developed the battery and powertrain for the RAV4 EV, which was released just 22 months after it went into development. A typical design cycle for a new vehicle is five years. The Tesla touch is apparent in the vehicle's architecture, and the RAV4 retained its cargo space instead of losing it to batteries because the battery pack was mounted low and at the center of the vehicle.The RAV4 EV has a maximum speed of 100 mph and can do 0-60 in seven seconds. The drivetrain has a maximum output of 154 horsepower.The new RAV4 EV is also exceptionally aerodynamic with a coefficient of drag of just 0.30 Cd, the lowest of any SUV in the world, according to Toyota. While the RAV4 EV is obviously very sleek, it also has developed a bit of the Prius lordosis and loses the rugged styling of the traditional, gasoline-powered RAV4.The interior of the new RAV4 EV has all the expected standards: touchscreen for navigation, audio, EV settings, etc., Bluetooth audio and USB connectivity. Toyota also says the interior will feature a unique 'Neutron' fabric, woven with a subtle sheen and blue accent, but it doesn't say whether the Neutron fabric would render driver and passengers as protons or electrons.Toyota Motor Corp.

Most of those funds have supported the rollout of its first vehicle, a $102,000 plug-in hybrid sportscar called the Karma that was plagued with production delays and a recent recall.Fisker's Wilmington, Delaware plant, a former General Motors Co (GM.N) factory, is expected to manufacture the company's second vehicle, a sedan known as the Nina. The $336 million balance of its DOE loan is intended to fund that car, Fisker said.Fisker spokesman Roger Ormisher would not elaborate on the reasons it was seeking revised terms for its government loan, but a DOE spokesman cited delays in getting the Karma to market.Our loan guarantees have strict conditions in place to protect taxpayers. The Department only allows the loan to be disbursed as the company meets certain milestones and demonstrates results, DOE spokesman Damien LaVera said.The Department is working with Fisker to review a revised business plan and determine the best path forward so the company can meet its benchmarks, produce cars and employ workers here in America.Energy Department loans and loan guarantees have been under heightened scrutiny from lawmakers since solar panel company Solyndra filed for bankruptcy in September after receiving a $535 million government loan in 2009.Last month, Fisker ratcheted down its sales projections for 2012, saying it expected to sell about 10,000 Karmas. It had originally hoped to sell 15,000 vehicles.Fisker is still aiming to begin production of the Nina in 2013, Ormisher said, though he said the company would give an exact timeline once it restarts work at the Delaware plant.In addition to the federal loan, Fisker has raised more than $850 million from private investors including Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, Advanced Equities and Qatar Investment Authority. That includes $260 million raised late last year, Fisker said.The fledgling automaker was founded in 2007 by Henrik Fisker, a onetime Aston Martin designer.The company is one of a slew of automakers betting heavily on hybrids and pure electric vehicles. Major carmakers including GM and Nissan Motor Co Ltd (7201.T) already have electric cars on the road, though the push for greener cars has also ushered in a host of venture-backed startups like Fisker and Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA.O).""]"

(NASDAQ:TSLA) could touch $42 in the next 12 months, driven by demand for its Model S electric car. Much of Tesla's future lies on the success of\xa0the Model S, its first sedan, which it hopes to start delivering to customers next year.The base version of Model S, with\xa0a 40-kilowatt-hour battery which will give 160 miles per charge,\xa0comes at\xa0$49,900 after 7,500 federal tax credit.In 2012, Model S pre-orders will be the primary driver of stock appreciation, Pacific-Crest Securities analyst Erik Olbeter has written in a note to clients.Olbeter expects 13,000 pre-orders by the end of first half of 2012. Pre-orders will be driven by new store openings, beta releases to the stores and test drives available starting in spring 2012. The test drive availability is critical to maintaining backlog momentum in the second quarter of 2012 and is an incremental positive to the story.For next the 12 months, nothing more is necessary to make Tesla work. If the Model S starts rolling in mid-2012 and the backlog of initial orders is filled, TSLA is likely to be worth at least $42, says Olbeter.However, the analyst has warned that Tesla's third-party OEM partners could fail miserably in selling EVs with Tesla's powertrain. But for Tesla investors, all of the third-party sales do not dent a business model that will sink or swim based on Tesla Model S and Model X sales.Olbeter has justified his outperform rating on Tesla stock saying that Tesla is not selling an electric vehicle, but it is selling a luxury automobile with an electric drivetrain.This is more than just semantics. It reflects the view that Tesla's products appeal to a broader set of customers than just environmentalists, who have not stepped up as expected to buy the Nissan Leaf or Chevy Volt, he said.\xa0Instead of selling a $12,000 car with a $20,000 battery, which very few view favorably, Tesla is selling a car that stands on its own against its peers in the luxury auto market.What Tesla's auto loses in driving range, it makes up in performance, and we believe that its infotainment system will set the standard by which other luxury cars are measured. In Asia, we expect Tesla to be one of the prime luxury statement purchases of 2013, the analyst has said.Olbeter says Tesla Motors' cutting-edge product lineup, low-cost battery technology/philosophy, elite brand and strong engineering skills position the company well for an on-time product launch and great initial sales.The analyst forecasts that Tesla will have 13,000 Model S pre-orders by the time the first Model S ships in July 2013. If pre-orders momentum accelerates in 2012 and the production schedule remains intact, shares will climb higher in tandem with confidence in 2013 earnings power.In addition, the analyst's checks suggest that Asian customer demand will be high for the fully loaded Model S. Tesla plans to ship the Model S to international customers at the beginning of 2013.Shares of Tesla Motors closed Tuesday's regular trading session at $27.90 on NASDAQ.""]"

(7203.T) and BMW AG (BMWG.DE) said on Thursday that they would work together on a broad range of advanced environment-friendly car technologies, including the joint development of lithium-ion batteries for electric vehicles.BMW will also supply 1.6 and 2.0 litre diesel engines to Toyota beginning in 2014, for cars to be sold in Europe, while the two agreed to identify and discuss other possible joint projects. Toyota said the agreement would allow it to expand its European product lineup.Fundamentally we are both engineering companies, so in many aspects we have found we speak the same language, and it is interesting to see what can be achieved when Japanese engineering meets European engineering and when the cooperation really works, Toyota Motor Europe President and Chief Executive Officer, Didier LeRoy, said at a news conference. However, company executives said there were no discussions on the tie-up expanding to include equity holdings.The hand-shake between the two industry stalwarts comes as automakers face ballooning research and development costs to meet tougher emissions and fuel-economy standards around the world. They must also meet consumers' varying preferences for vehicle powertrains across different regions.Rivals Nissan Motor Co. (7201.T) and Daimler AG (DAIGn.DE) have been especially aggressive in pursuing partnerships to save costs.The tie-up in diesel technology could represent a reversal in Toyota's strategy after it scrapped plans two years ago to develop 1.6-litre diesel engines with Japanese truck maker Isuzu Motors Ltd (7202.T), in which it owns a 5.9 percent stake.Two and a half years ago, Toyota's President, Akio Toyoda said, at his first news conference, the company would shift its focus in Europe to hybrids and away from diesel so as not to get lost in the crowd. However,\xa0Toyota has lost market share in Europe, partly due to a dearth of diesel cars, which make up more than half of new vehicle sales in the region. Diesel engines use less fuel and emit less carbon dioxide than gasoline engines.While virtually all car makers acknowledge that hybrid technology will be necessary when regulations become tighter, it has never accounted for more than 2 percent of global vehicle sales and Toyota has not been able to leverage its strength in the technology to gain traction in the European market.Under Toyoda, Japan's top automaker has forged numerous partnerships, including those with Aston Martin, Tesla Motors Inc. (TSLA.O), Microsoft Corp. (MSFT.O), Salesforce.com and Ford Motor Co. (F.N).BMW's Sales and Marketing Chief, Ian Robertson, said at the Tokyo Motor Show on Wednesday that he expected to see more tie-ups among car makers and that the German premium car maker remained open to cooperation as long as it did not dilute its brand. It has a deal to work on common components with Daimler and on hybrids with PSA Peugeot Citroen.Toyota shares rose 2.3 percent on Thursday in Tokyo, in line with gains in the benchmark Nikkei average.\xa0""]"
https://www.ibtimes.com/no-longer-beast-toyota-strives-beauty-366290,"No longer the beast, Toyota strives for beauty",Peggy Truong,11/07/11,11:33 AM,"[""As Toyota Motor President Akio Toyoda passed the banged-up Aston Martin Zagato in his Lexus LFA on the Nuerburgring race track last month, he figured that was it for the British race car.Toyoda and Aston Martin CEO Ulrich Bez, both recognized for their contribution to motorsports by the German auto industry this year, were meant to switch cars later and cross the finish line side by side -- Bez in the Lexus, the Toyota (7203.T: Quote, Profile, Research, Stock Buzz) chief in the Zagato.I thought, 'that doesn't look good, Toyoda, an amateur racer, recalled after the four-hour endurance race at the track, in Germany's Eifel region. I think everybody did.The mishap seemed like a metaphor for the road his company has travelled since Toyoda took over more than two years ago.His appointment in June 2009 came as the $115 billion company reported its first loss in decades, after the global financial crisis forced it to idle the many factories it had built over a decade of relentless expansion. That growth in pursuit of profits came at the expense of quality and innovation, critics said.Akio Toyoda, the first member of Toyoda family to take the helm since 1995, vowed at the start to take the automaker founded by his grandfather back to the basics of building cars that made people happy.Barely six months later, the company plunged into its worst quality crisis in decades. Toyota took a firestorm of criticism over the slow response to recalling millions of cars to check for faulty accelerators in the United States. The safety crisis, which forced Toyoda to testify before Congress in February last year, threatened Toyota's reputation and continued success in its most profitable market.Today, even as the world's biggest automaker is turning the corner on that crisis, with new evidence indicating human error and not faulty electronics was the cause behind most of the cases of unintended acceleration, things hardly look any better.The yen, hovering around record highs, is hurting its price competitiveness. Japan's once-in-a-millennium earthquake and tsunami and Thailand's historic floods, have caused severe supply chain disruptions.But perhaps the biggest challenge for a company Nissan chief executive Carlos Ghosn used to call the Beast is Toyota's brand image as a maker of durable and environmentally friendly cars -- but not much else.Once the world's most envied car maker, Toyota is no longer the benchmark for rivals such as Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE: Quote, Profile, Research, Stock Buzz) or Nissan Motor Co (7201.T: Quote, Profile, Research, Stock Buzz). That honor these days goes to a fast-rising Hyundai Motor Co (005380.KS: Quote, Profile, Research, Stock Buzz), whose stylish cars are making Toyota's look blander than ever.Toyota can't get by with its quality reputation alone anymore, said Kurt Sanger, a Tokyo-based auto analyst at Deutsche Securities.Fairly or unfairly, that's been tarnished by the recalls. But even before that, the other guys were getting better while introducing more interesting products. For Toyota to just continue to do what it was doing was not an option. It ignored that for awhile.Toyoda, a self-proclaimed 'car guy', acknowledges in an interview with Reuters at the race track in Germany that his company may no longer be the beast, but it can still try to be the beauty.His quest is to reboot the culture of a company that hasn't been sexy for years. He wants investors to give him a longer time-frame to do that -- even if it takes another decade or so.GRAND ENTRANCEAt media events, the 55-year-old Toyoda is known for his grand entrances driving a car, whether it's in the all-new Camry at Toyota's factory in Kentucky or a 30-year-old Kijang truck in Jakarta. At staid company functions, he brings in an LFA and starts the engine, filling hotel banquet rooms with the smell of petrol and the rumble of the supercar's V10 engine.By the next day, no one will remember the speech I made, Toyoda, dressed in a red racing suit, said before the October 15 race at Nuerburgring. But they'll never forget that sound and smell.Earlier this year, young men and women offered a job at Toyota in Japan were invited to the company's test track to celebrate. As they stood facing a stage to be introduced to Toyota's race car drivers, Toyoda circled the track on an LFA for sound effect.Nobody knew it was me. After the introductions, I pulled up to make my remarks, he said proudly, flipping through photos from that day on his iPad. In those remarks, I asked them if they liked cars and that if they didn't, they shouldn't bother joining.Toyoda's campaign to inspire the group's 300,000 employees to build more exciting cars was strengthened, he said, when he appeared on CNN's Larry King Live after the grilling from U.S. lawmakers last year. The turning point from that trying saga, Toyoda said, came when King posed his final question: What car do you drive?I thought to myself, should I say Prius? Would that sound good? he remembered. But then I decided to just let go and I felt a smile return to my face. I told him, 'I drive about 200 a year. I love cars.'Toyoda said the incident made him realize that focusing on the product is what saved him from a crisis he had assumed would lead to his early resignation to take responsibility for the recalls.He renewed his vow to lead Toyota into a new chapter with cars as the leading protagonist, declaring the day of the U.S. congressional hearings -- February 24, 2010 -- the beginning of a company renaissance.HYUNDAI THREATBut making good cars requires profits, and profits have been tough to come by lately.The yen's persistent strength has been especially tough for Toyota, which exports about 1.5 million vehicles from Japan, nowadays at a loss. Even though the dollar is nowhere near the 90 yen Toyoda says is appropriate, he has vowed to keep building at least 3 million vehicles a year in Japan - three times that of Nissan or Honda Motor Co (7267.T: Quote, Profile, Research, Stock Buzz). Toyoda says the company has a social obligation to protect jobs and keep a strong manufacturing base in Japan.That commitment only strengthened after the March 11 disasters, and became the source of a public debate earlier this year with his chief financial officer, Satoshi Ozawa, who noted that building all those cars in Japan defied logic.All the while, Hyundai has been borrowing from Toyota's business model to become a global powerhouse, helped in part by various free trade agreements Seoul has signed and a relatively cheaper currency.While motor journalists such as Tetsuya Kato welcome Toyoda's new focus on making hotter cars, he said success wasn't guaranteed.The Koreans are really coming at them, said Kato, publisher of Japan's Car Graphic magazine. If Japan keeps going at this snail's pace (with free trade deals), there's a real possibility that Japanese automakers will lose.Toyoda has no qualms about putting the front-runner label on Hyundai, and isn't interested in the noise about losing the title as the world's top-selling automaker - something that could go to Volkswagen this year.I think Hyundai is making great cars, and in some ways I think we're trailing them, he said in the interview.We have so much more room to improve. But as long as you know that - it's like Steve Jobs said at the end of that speech: 'Stay hungry. Stay foolish.' Those words really spoke to me, he said, referring to the commencement address the late Apple CEO delivered at Stanford University in 2005.In the short term, you win some and lose some. But we're working hard to build Toyota into a company that attracts investors who would look back 15 years and be glad they owned our shares. It's the difference between thinking of 10 years in the span of 10 years, versus 10 years as a part of 100 years.For now, though, investors aren't impressed -- Toyota's shares are down 20 percent so far this year while Hyundai's have surged 25 percent.CHANGE AGENTWhile Toyoda may want to be judged over the long term, those who know him say he is constantly challenging the status quo and grows irritable when he senses resistance to change.He holds weekly meetings with his five executive vice presidents in a free-flowing style with no prepared documents -- a departure from past practice.Soon after the recall debacle, Toyoda gave regional operations more autonomy to make the company more nimble. In a management shake-up this year, he slashed the number of directors to 11 from 27 to speed up decision-making.A few of his own speedy decisions, though, have raised concerns in some quarters that Toyoda was perhaps flouting Toyota's process-driven, consensus-building culture. One employee wondered whether Toyoda's was a top-down management style -- like Apple's Jobs -- and whether he had it in him to take the blame for any major missteps he might make.I get the sense that he listens carefully to people when the subject is outside his comfort zone, said the employee, who declined to give his name or rank. What I'm not sure about is whether he'll do the same in areas he's familiar with. And when he makes that executive decision on a car, for example, and it turns out to be a flop, would he take responsibility?Toyoda surprised even his chief engineer, Takeshi Uchiyamada, with last year's shock tie-up with Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA.O: Quote, Profile, Research, Stock Buzz) after only a month after hitting it off with the electric vehicle start-up's young founder, Elon Musk. In the end, the executive vice president credited Toyoda for achieving his main goal of having the Silicon Valley company's entrepreneurial spirit rub off, at least on a small scale.When the Tesla team came up with an electric prototype of Toyota's RAV4 crossover in just three weeks to display at the Los Angeles auto show, young Toyota engineers challenged themselves to do it faster.They used their own free time and converted an old (Toyota) MR-S sports car into an electric car in 16 days, Uchiyamada recalled earlier this year. If we did things the old way, we wouldn't even have a proposal in that time.Another executive said the skepticism will never end because of the baggage that comes with Toyoda's name.He'll just have to be judged on his achievements when his tenure is over, whenever that may be, he told Reuters by telephone, requesting anonymity.But from my perspective, he's already got a proven track record. All the big decisions in the past two years have been his; pulling out of Formula One, for instance, and the various tie-ups with other companies such as Tesla. I think he's a talented leader, and a decisive one.Analysts said it's too early to say whether Toyoda will succeed.But back in the day, they used to say that Ford (F.N: Quote, Profile, Research, Stock Buzz) went downhill because the company grew too big, and the bean counters became too powerful, said Tatsuo Yoshida, an auto analyst at UBS Securities. If he can really steer the focus back to products in areas that aren't directly involved with making them, like R&D, I think it would be good for Toyota's corporate culture.REVAMPING LEXUSToyoda is focusing first on his premium line, hoping to seduce customers with a revamped Lexus.In April, he created a direct reporting line to himself for the Lexus division, personally testing the latest GS 350 sedan at Nuerburgring many times. The car was then re-engineered for a more rigid body, lighter suspension and reduced body roll, among others. The 2012 Camry, launched in August, was also sent back for major modifications, especially to improve the interior.As a true car guy he really gets into the weeds in design, development and production, Jim Lentz, head of Toyota's U.S. sales arm, told Reuters in an email. He has our associates and dealers excited about the business and the future again. He is exactly what we need at this point in time to get back on track.Lentz said empowering each region has allowed for faster decisions to meet local consumers' tastes.I think you see evidence of that already in the Camry and will continue to see it as we launch 20 all-new cars and trucks over the next several years, he wrote.Toyoda said it was only a start.I think we exceeded some level of expectation with it, he said about the remodeling of the Camry, America's best-selling car.But I'm talking about much, much more than that. I don't want it to be about rolling out a new car for a scheduled model change. I want people to be wondering, 'What's the next Corolla going to be like?' and be full of anticipation. It's going to take time, but that's the kind of car launch we're aiming for.Deutsche's Sanger said it will take a few more years to see any transformation because cars typically take three to five years to develop.But it's a good thing to see someone who wants to talk about product at Toyota, he said. If that translates into more engaging vehicles, then ultimately that has to be better for everyone. The people making them should sell more of them, the people selling them should get a better price from them, and investors should see better returns because of that. The success or failure of the next generation of products will be his legacy.WE DID IT!Toyoda and his company have a ways to go, but they are clearly trying to root their new corporate culture at least in part at the race track.As Toyota prepares to launch the first Toyota-badged sports car since 2007, it is doing so without top test driver, Hiromu Naruse, who left his mark on some of its most iconic cars such as the 2000GT, Celica, and Supra.Naruse was also the reason Toyoda gave up his weekend golf routine and hit the tracks more than a decade ago, after he criticized the young executive for being ignorant about the finer points of driving. Toyota's revered test driver died last year just outside Nuerburgring, crashing the LFA he had helped fine-tune.At the four-hour race, a lesson for Toyota's mechanics came unexpectedly in the form of Aston Martin's crash.Barely one hour into the race, the Zagato driven by Aston Martin's Chris Porritt was towed back to its tent after getting rear-ended and crashing off the course. The back end was smashed in, the front was banged up and it was leaking fluids. Toyota's Gazoo Racing staff, like Toyoda, figured it was over.Aston Martin's mechanics didn't. Although the race was lost, they were determined to patch up the car enough to give Toyoda one last lap for the finish.They set that goal and reached it, despite the pressure of putting a V.I.P. in the driver's seat, said Toshiyuki Sekiya, a chief mechanic for the LFA. That's a decision we may not have been able to take. It's given us something to think about.With just minutes left on the clock, members from both teams rolled the bright-green Zagato, its headlights covered in duct-tape, onto the track for Toyoda's final run.Against the odds, the LFA and Zagato crossed the finish line at the last straightaway in tandem, as Gazoo Racing and Aston Martin's members cheered from the sidelines.A beaming Toyoda and jubilant Bez emerged from their machines, embraced, and posed for the cameras.We did it! they kept saying.

(MDVN) stock jumped 117.48 percent to $35.95 in the pre-market trading. Medivation and Astellas Pharma Inc. announced that the Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) has informed the companies of positive results from a planned interim analysis of the Phase 3 AFFIRM trial of MDV3100 in men with advanced prostate cancer previously treated with chemotherapy. MDV3100, the first androgen receptor signaling inhibitor, successfully met the study's pre-specified interim efficacy stopping criteria, demonstrating a clinically meaningful and statistically significant (p < 0.0001) improvement in overall survival compared to placebo. As a result, the IDMC recommended that AFFIRM be stopped early and men who received placebo be offered MDV3100.As reported by the IDMC, MDV3100 produced a 4.8-month advantage in median overall survival compared to placebo. The estimated median survival for men treated with MDV3100 was 18.4 months compared with 13.6 months for men treated with placebo. MDV3100 provided a 37 percent reduction in risk of death compared to placebo (Hazard Ratio=0.631). The IDMC further determined, considering the observed safety profile, that MDV3100 demonstrated a favorable risk-to-benefit ratio sufficient to stop the study. A full analysis of the results from AFFIRM, including safety data, will be submitted for presentation at an upcoming scientific congress. Medivation and Astellas plan to hold a pre-NDA meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in early 2012 and will provide an update on regulatory timelines for MDV3100 subsequent to that meeting.

It has since sold 3.3 million hybrid vehicles. led by the Prius, which like most fuel-efficient cars, has front-wheel drive.Rear-wheel drive vehicles in the U.S. market include sports cars and high-performance sedans.This is the kind of collaborative effort that is required to address the big global challenges of energy independence and environmental sustainability, Ford Chief Executive Alan Mulally said in a prepared statement.Toyota President Akio Toyoda, also in a prepared statement, said the tie-up should also become an important building block for future mobility in the U.S.While Toyota has led in hybrid sales, Ford has been a leader in pickup trucks, which are predominately sold in the United States and Canada. Its F-series pickup trucks have been the best-selling vehicle in the U.S. market since the 1970s.The two companies will work on the details of a fuller agreement expected sometime in 2012 that will lay out more specifically how they will collaborate, Kuzak said.Costs and scope of the collaboration have not yet been worked out, Uchiyamada said, adding it was too early to tell if one company may bear more of the costs.Uchiyamada led Toyota engineers in developing the Prius.\xa0TOYOTA U.S. SALES WOEThe tie-up also comes at a time when Toyota faces tougher competition in the United States, its most important market.It had risen to No. 2 in sales behind only General Motors\xa0on the U.S. market, but has since fallen behind Ford.Toyota's U.S. sales fell 7 percent in the U.S. market through July. Toyota has been struggling to restore sales momentum in the U.S. market after the March earthquake in Japan forced production disruptions.Ford's U.S. sales rose 12 percent in the first seven months of 2011.By allying with Ford, Toyota is also taking aim at an area of vehicle technology where executives acknowledge that the Japanese automaker has lagged: on-board navigation and entertainment systems.Ford won sales and consideration from young car shoppers with its Sync system, an option that allows drivers to control stereos and cell phones with voice activated commands. The follow-up system, MyFord Touch, proved to be less popular with the high-end buyers Ford targeted.MULALLY, TOYODA MEETINGSFord CEO Mulally has long professed admiration for Toyota going back to his days as a Boeing\xa0executive, when he studied and borrowed heavily from the Japanese automaker's lean production system.Mulally and Toyoda have met several times since 2007, and set the groundwork for talks that began in April this year between teams led by Uchiyamada and Kuzak.Early in his tenure at Ford, Mulally approached Toyota to seek a deal intended to speed Ford's turnaround.Ford, led by Mulally, was able to go from losing money to profitability and develop a more diversified model lineup without that tie-in with Toyota.When Mulally became Ford CEO in October 2006, the company was on its way to losing $30 billion from 2006 to 2008. Soon after his arrival, Ford borrowed heavily to fund a restructuring that helped it become the only Detroit automaker to avoid bankruptcy in 2009.Ford in 2010 showed its best profit since 1999.Both automakers face pressure from a resurgent GM, which is investing heavily in plug-in hybrid technology. Last week, GM announced plans for a second rechargeable hybrid based on the technology used in the first, the Chevy Volt. [ID:nN1E77G1E9]Both Toyota and Ford have entered into previous collaborations to share technology and development costs.Under Toyoda, the Japanese automaker has invested in Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA.O) and struck a deal to cooperate in producing an electric vehicle based on the RAV4 small SUV.Ford works with GM to develop transmissions for the North American market, and with French automaker PSA Peugeot Citroen (PEUP.PA) for development of some diesel engines in Europe.On Monday afternoon, Ford shares were up 0.6 percent at $10.06 per share and Toyota's U.S. shares were down 0.2 percent at $70.53 per share after closing in Tokyo down 2.5 percent at 2,700 yen ($35.30) per share.""]"

Top Gear’s allegation that the car’s range is 55 miles is defamatory because it suggests Tesla grossly misled potential purchasers of the Roadster, the filing said.Randgold Resources Ltd. (GOLD) stock increased 3.89 percent to $76.90 in the pre-market trading. The company reiterated the 2011 production guidance of 750,000 and 790,000 ounces of gold this year, with the recently commissioned Tongon mine in the Ivory Coast still scheduled to produce 260,000 to 270,000 ounces. The guidance reiteration was published alongside the group's annual report that showed the company had raised its reserves and resources for the eighth consecutive year.Dendreon Corp. (DNDN) stock gained 3.80 percent to $36.89 in the pre-market trading. The company said the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has issued a proposed decision memo for PROVENGE. In the draft decision memo, CMS proposes that the evidence is adequate to conclude that the use of autologous cellular immunotherapy with PROVENGE improves health outcomes for Medicare beneficiaries with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer and thus is reasonable and necessary for that indication.Clean Energy Fuels Corp. (CLNE) stock rose 3.17 percent to $16.92 in the pre-market trading. The company said it received a contract from the Metropolitan Tulsa Transit Authority (MTTA) of Tulsa, Oklahoma to design, build, operate and maintain a compressed natural gas (CNG) fueling station to support the agency’s growing fleet of CNG-powered buses and paratransit vehicles.Slated to open in September 2011, the new Tulsa Transit fueling facility will be equipped with 39 time-fill posts and one fast-fill CNG dispenser. The new station, located at MTTA’s vehicle maintenance facility, will support the agency’s accelerating program to replace 100 percent of its diesel-powered bus fleet with clean, green, cost-efficient CNG models.Currently Tulsa Transit deploys 63 fixed-route buses and 49 paratransit vehicles in a 197- square-mile area that includes the communities of Tulsa, Jenks, Broken Arrow and Sand Springs. Annual ridership tops 2.8 million passenger trips. In 2011, Tulsa Transit expects to add 35 new CNG paratransit vehicles and 15 CNG buses to its fleet, replacing diesel models as they are retired from service this year.LosersSinovac Biotech Ltd. (SVA) stock plunged 8.99 percent to $4 in the pre-market trading. Loss for the fourth quarter was $8.9 million or $0.17 a share, compared to earnings of $8.9 million or $0.21 a share last year.

The committee has indicated to HLC that there may be recommendations for corrective action to be monitored through HLC's monitoring processes.University of Phoenix expects to provide a thorough response to the committee's questions in a timely manner, and looks forward to its continuing dialog with HLC. University of Phoenix noted in this regard, that many of the areas which are the focus of the committee's additional questions are areas where it have been active in the past several quarters in further enhancing the student experience and its already strong student protections.SciQuest, Inc.

https://www.ibtimes.com/porter-stansberry-bumpy-road-ahead-go-blue-chips-gold-252321,Porter Stansberry: Bumpy Road Ahead; Go for Blue Chips and Gold,IBT Staff Reporter,12/30/10,9:01 PM,"[""Steady tailwinds benefited the stock market for most of 2010, but Stansberry & Associates Investment Research Founder Porter Stansberry is bracing himself and his clients for a bumpy ride for equities in the new year, as well as unprecedented instability in muni bonds and Treasuries. In this exclusive interview with The Gold Report, Porter, who's been predicting the dire consequences of unbridled borrowing and continued quantitative easing for some time, recommends utmost caution and conservatism for investors in 2011.The Gold Report: Much has happened since our last discussion in September. The election, with the Republicans taking the House and the super majority in the Senate. QE2 (quantitative easing) not only discussed but actually released. The U.S. assisting in the financing in Europe. The benefactors of the 2008 bailout money finally published. And then the hottest topic in Washington for a while, extending the Bush tax credits along with an Obama unemployment tax credit. Have any of these developments changed or firmed your opinion of the U.S. economy or the international monetary crisis?Porter Stansberry: I'm fascinated by the way the crisis is unfolding. The U.S. government is still willing to add enormous amounts of new debt. And it is willing to underwrite not only quantitative easing in the U.S. but also fund it in Europe as well. These are symptoms of a much bigger ongoing problem-the enormous sovereign debt crisis in the Western democracies.I think we're going to see a lot more quantitative easing. We're going to have to see a lot more fiscal deficit growth going forward, especially with a union between the Republican House that wants to cut taxes and the Obama administration that wants to extend benefits. You let us cut taxes and we'll agree to extend benefits. Of course, that's the worst of both worlds in terms of our fiscal position because it will result in vastly bigger spending and less tax revenue. There's no other government that will even attempt adding vast new debts at this stage in the game. Americans still have no idea of the risks our government is taking with our currency.TGR: The international quantitative easing you mentioned was in Europe. Is it only the Western countries that concern you and not Asia?PS: There's been a dichotomy in the world financial markets over the last 30 years between the developed markets and the developing markets. Brazil, for example, always had to pay a lot more in interest to borrow money than governments in developed nations. We're seeing a whole new kind of order in the markets. Think of countries that simply run sound fiscal policies-such as Canada, Switzerland, Singapore and Hong Kong. You can probably throw a couple more in there now, such as Brazil.In places with current account balances or surpluses, the currencies continue to strengthen versus the U.S. dollar. Bond yields continue to decline versus the U.S. dollar. Meanwhile, places that used to be considered safe, such as France, the U.K. and the U.S., are seeing bond yields go higher and currencies go lower. This is a new bifurcation in the world markets that's completely related to the ongoing policy decisions of these major Western countries, where governments have always had easy access to credit markets. There is a belief, at least on the part of the American people, that they can borrow money forever without consequence. I'm sure you'll recall the famous Dick Cheney remark that deficits don't matter.I believe we are at the end of the line of those policies. And that's why we've had to begin to fund our fiscal deficits with just printing paper. That's what quantitative easing is. I think we're at a real crisis point, where for the first time ever America's creditors are beginning to abandon the dollar. You see that in two ways. Number one, for the first time since the early 1970s, central banks are now net buyers of gold again. Number two is the huge move down in the bond market that you've seen just really recently since the last round of quantitative easing began in the U.S. This is a really big change.TGR: And an important one.PS: It certainly is, and right now we have a situation where the muni bond market in the U.S. is crashing. Muni bonds are falling 2% or 3% every week. These bonds shouldn't decline at all. People have long thought of the muni bond market as the safest place in the bond market for retirees' money. Well, now it's in freefall. Normally, if you took money out of the muni bond market, you'd put it in the Treasury bond market. That's the only thing that's even safer. But both markets now are in decline. People are selling both muni bonds and Treasury bonds at the same time. That's a sign of a major problem in the fixed income markets. And, because the U.S. bond markets are the largest securities markets in the world, that means we're in the midst of a major, major financial crisis. I don't really think people realize it yet.TGR: Are you referring to the general population?PS: When I talk to people, when I talk to news commentators, when I do interviews, when I talk to investors, when I go to investment conferences, when I talk to very well-known hedge fund managers. . .all of these people have some idea that things are going wrong. Lots of them say they're worried about being on the verge of a big crisis. I think we're in one. So, I ask them, rhetorically, what do they have to see in the markets before they realize the crisis is underway?How high does the price of gold have to go? How far do Treasury bonds and muni bonds have to fall? How far does the dollar have to decline on a trade-weighted basis? How high does unemployment have to go? How big do the fiscal deficits have to grow? They don't have any answers to those questions because all of the thresholds have been violated already. Two years ago, no one would've thought it possible for the muni bond market and the Treasury bond market to both fall as much as they have fallen in the last six weeks at the same time. That just didn't happen ever before.TGR: So if we've passed all those thresholds, why doesn't the general media say we're in a crisis?PS: Even though the currency markets and the bond markets are vastly larger, the stock market hasn't cracked open yet, and for whatever reason, the major media focus is almost entirely on the stock market. Until stocks fall 20% or so, the media won't panic. But God help you if you're still long on stocks when the nightly news begins to feature the core financial problems we face.TGR: You've been advising people to get into so-called real asset classes such as agriculture, gold, silver, various forms of energy. But won't all stocks be worthless in an economic catastrophe and global hyperinflation?PS: Stocks actually can be a very good hedge against inflation, and short of hyperinflation, stocks will have the ability to increase their dividends to match the rise in prices. Now I say short of hyperinflation; if we get to real hyperinflation all that's off the table and you're exactly right.So what we're doing now is buying what we think are the best hedges against inflation-energy, agriculture and hard money-silver and gold bullion. We're also selling short lots of stocks that are overly in debt or are obsolete, such as newspapers or hard drive companies. Earlier this year, I told people that if they aren't willing to short stocks to hedge their portfolios they should only be in cash and gold, and they shouldn't own any stocks.TGR: You said investors who aren't willing to short stocks should stay in cash and gold. But cash value is getting inflated away with quantitative easing. Why put anything in cash if it won't appreciate? Why not put it all in gold?PS: When you're dealing with a bankrupt sovereign- like the U.S. government-you're dealing with a very powerful wounded bear. You have to be very careful because you can't know what the beast is going to do. You have to balance against both the risks of the ongoing inflation and the risks of a government reaction to the falling value of the dollar. If you put 50% of your portfolio in very short-term Treasury bonds, like one-year Treasury bonds, and the other 50% in gold, you've really set up a perfectly hedged position. You've gone to a very liquid position where you could hold on to what you've got safely. If the dollar falls, you're protected. If the government acts to reduce the price of gold, you're hedged. No matter what happens, you'll have liquidity and there's very little chance of losing purchasing power.TGR: But if it's perfectly hedged, doesn't one offset the other and you have not then increased wealth?PS: True, you're just treading water. But in periods of a crisis just treading water is actually a very good return. It's easy to say, Oh, I'll just go all to gold. But the government can't allow gold prices to continue to escalate without losing credibility for their paper, so what if the government decides to shake up the gold market? What if they do something to influence the price of gold negatively in a very severe way? I'm not saying they would confiscate all the gold, although they could. They could change margin requirements or launch an investigation of the gold ETF. They could do all kinds of things to undermine the gold market that could send gold prices down 20% or 30% in the short term. If that happened and you had all of your savings in gold it would be extremely uncomfortable. In the meantime, if you were long 50% dollars and 50% gold you still would have made more than 10% this year. So you're actually doing just fine. You're just doing so in a way that recognizes we're in a very dangerous and unstable period of time.TGR: In our last conversation, you recommended-at least for 2010-buying the highest-quality blue-chip companies in America that had good global businesses that are really cheap. You gave a couple of examples, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (NYSE:WMT), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). You pointed out they were paying increasing dividends, in fact, at a higher rate than clipping the coupons for these particular companies. Will that continue to be a good strategy through 2011?PS: Yes. I strongly endorse that strategy. High-quality blue-chip international businesses are very cheap right now. Their global earnings offer a lot of protection against a dollar decline. Intel makes something like 75% of its sales outside the U.S. dollar. That's global protection via a very high-quality business that has a fantastic protective moat, has very high margins and has a shareholder-friendly board and a business model.But while you can use equities to hedge against the risk of inflation, unfortunately you can't use them to hedge against the risk of a hyperinflation. That's why I've also been urging people to buy silver and gold bullion and to be willing to hedge their long exposure by shorting some very low-quality stocks.TGR: To summarize where we've been-we're looking at having bullion, blue chips and a short portfolio. Earlier in our conversation we were talking about such investment hedges as agriculture and energy. Where do those fit into what we've just discussed?PS: When it comes to energy stocks, we like very high-quality integrated blue chips. We like stocks that are involved in the Eagle Ford discovery in south Texas. And we like what are essentially royalty companies, companies that get paid to extract the hydrocarbons from their property, like San Juan Basin Royalty Trust (NYSE:SJT).When it comes to agricultural stocks, we've written a lot about Monsanto (NYSE:MON), which I know is a controversial business but I think is a very good long-term bet. Having talked to global food company CEOs recently, I'm convinced that Monsanto's seeds are the only way to significantly increase agricultural production globally. That has to happen to keep pace with rising populations. You can also look at a company such as Cresud Inc. (NASDAQ:CRESY), which is managed by one of our friends, Eduardo Elsztain, and is a very good business in South America that owns huge soybean farms. There are all kind of different ways to get exposed to agriculture but those are some of the ideas that I think would be good for investors to consider.TGR: You've mentioned that agriculture is one of the most important inflation hedges primarily because we all need to eat food.PS: Hard money is the most important inflation hedge, something like gold and silver, for the simple reason that if you own plenty of gold and silver you can buy any other commodities you need because you own real money. Then energy comes in behind agriculture because you have to eat before you drive your car anywhere.In terms of increasing productivity, the big problem for agriculture has been the rise of various political movements that oppose expanding farmland. Other political problems go to various subsidies and regulations. For example, in Europe not only are farmers prohibited from using Monsanto genetically modified organism (GMO) seeds, which makes it very difficult to increase crop yield, but the governments continue to pay farmers not to plant. The United States government also pays farmers not to plant certain crops. All kinds of political incentives against increasing production don't make much sense but they exist.Some food CEOs are very concerned that as global inflation accelerates, there's a big risk of a trade war and a currency war. They're really afraid that some of the people in the poorer countries will begin to starve.TGR: When we last spoke you said that you were still trying to survive 2010 and weren't prepared to talk about your expectations of 2011 because we weren't there yet. Well, we're almost there now. How well did you survive 2010? And can you make any predictions for 2011?PS: I don't have the final tally on all of our results but I know we've done very well. Through early December the average profit on the nine stocks we recommended buying during 2010 was 7.5%, led by a 42% gain in San Juan Basin Royalty Trust. Don't forget these recommendations were all super-safe, blue-chip stocks. Our single-digit average return was very much on purpose. We didn't feel comfortable on the long side of the market in 2010. Meanwhile, the average profit on our six recommended short sells was 17.5%, led by a 51% gain shorting Seagate, a hard drive maker we think is going to zero.Two things to remember about these results. First, they're just plain averages. Lots of newsletter editors will annualize their results to account for the fact that the model portfolio isn't fully invested all year, as recommendations go out monthly. We don't do that because you can't eat annualized results. Second, these results don't include any of our hard money recommendations. Buying gold and silver would have added significantly to your gains this year-as we predicted. Gold is up 27% this year. Silver is up 75%.As you know, it's one thing to pick stocks and it's another thing to actually make money in the markets. Our primary goal is to help real people make real money. Our portfolio is designed to make double-digit annual returns, no matter what happens in the markets. Including our bullion allocation, I'd estimate that a reader would have earned more than 15% last year on their whole portfolio, even though the portfolio would have been completely hedged the entire year, and would have had a very large cash position for the first six months. Those are world-class risk-adjusted returns and I'm very proud of how we've done.Unfortunately, I believe it's going to be tougher to make money 2011. I expect the government to strike back. I don't think they're going to let commodity prices continue to soar. I'm very concerned about the repercussions of that on investors. So if I was very conservative in 2010 I've become downright scared in 2011. I don't yet know how we're going to hide, but I can tell you it's going to be a very large combination of hedges. We're going to have to continue to be very, very conservative in our allocations and make sure that we're prepared for any potential eventuality.I really do think we'll have a huge correction, particularly in the silver market. I'm a major silver bull, and I believe silver is inherently worth $120 an ounce already and it's going higher. But markets just don't go straight up the way silver has in the last couple of months. So I'm concerned that my subscribers may think that we can buy agriculture and energy with impunity and that we can buy as much silver and leverage it as much as we want without getting destroyed by the market volatility, just because we're in the middle of an inflationary crisis. I think we're going to see some of that volatility next year. I don't have a crystal ball, but it seems as if there needs to be a shakeout in the market because the investors have gotten so bullish on these ideas about sound money and energy and agriculture.TGR: You expect it to be tougher to make money 2011 because the government will strike back. What tools do they have to strike back at investors?PS: They have all the tools in the world. They could do all kinds of things. They could pass huge new withholding taxes on any kind of investment in bullion, for example. They could change the rules on the commodity exchanges. They could make rules about prices and windfall profit taxes. There's any number of things they can do to distort the markets and punish speculators, and there's no doubt in my mind that they will do some of them. There's no doubt in my mind that at some point next year Obama is going to come out, point the finger at the camera and say, An international group of speculators is destroying our bond markets. We're going to stop them.I'm expecting some big volatility next year. You have to be willing to be careful with the size of the positions that you're putting on and with your expectations about volatility. Things are going to get really volatile.TGR: Does that mean investors need to be more fluid in and out of the market? Not day trading, but more actively trading in and out?PS: My recommendation is just to be more conservative. Hold larger cash positions than you otherwise might. When you do go to buy a security or take a position in a commodity, make sure the price seems relatively good. It's very difficult to do that when it comes to commodities because it's impossible to determine a real true intrinsic value. I mean, what's gold really worth? It's an impossible question.But I would just use common sense. Silver, for example, has gone from let's say $15 an ounce to almost $30 an ounce just in the last six months. Buying a commodity after it's doubled in six months is probably not such a good idea. The same goes for buying a stock such as Tesla Motors, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA). This electric sports car company has borrowed a tremendous amount of money and can't possibly make a profit, so it's probably not a good idea for next year-unless you're shorting it.As interest rates go up, as the U.S. bond market begins to look a little more attractive to investors, the long bond might break through the 6% barrier next year. That would have a huge impact on equity valuation because if you have theoretically a risk-free rate of 6%, oh man, equities are going to be worth a lot less than people think they are.TGR: Theoretical is the operative word there.PS: Of course. It's not at all risk-free. In fact, it's a guaranteed way to lose money because the inflation rate is certain to exceed 6% next year, but my point is, if yields on government bonds keep backing up, then at some point it's going to impact equity valuations, which are already far too high. And that means, at some point in 2011 we're going to see a big correction in stock prices.TGR: Porter, in closing, are there any other insights you'd like to provide to our readers?PS: Just the same thing that I've been saying for a long time. We're in the midst of a crisis and this is a time to be unbelievably conservative with your investments. You can't assume that anything is safe anymore. People have been hiding their savings in muni bonds. They're going to get wiped out next year. People who have been hiding their savings in Treasury bonds are getting wiped out right now. People have been thinking that they can put an unlimited amount of money long in gold and silver and that they're only going to make money. That's not going to happen next year. There's going to be some volatility. So I would urge people to take some profits early, to keep some money in cash and to just simply be very conservative. If you have two investment choices, one of which is speculative and one of which is conservative, go with the conservative one. It's going to be a tough year in the markets.Editor's Note: Porter recently put together a presentation to show people exactly how dire things have gotten...and to discuss possible solutions for you and your family.

https://www.ibtimes.com/tesla-increases-size-ipo-20-percent-420197,Tesla increases size of IPO by 20 percent,IBT Staff Reporter,06/28/10,2:56 PM,"[""Electric carmaker Tesla Motors raised the number of shares it will sell in its initial public offering by 20 percent, an early sign that investor interest in the startup is strong.The increase, which comes the same day the shares are expected to price, increases the number of shares being offered to 13.3 million from 11.1 million, according to a regulatory filing.Tesla maintained the expected price range at $14 to $16 a share. Based on the midpoint of $15 a share, the IPO could raise about $200 million.The Palo Alto, California-based company's public debut comes amid growing interest in green technology and battery-powered vehicles, and as major automakers are gearing up to launch electric cars.The final pricing of the shares is expected later on Monday, and the stock is set to trade on the Nasdaq exchange on Tuesday under the symbol TSLA.Tesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk, during the company's roadshow last week, characterized the IPO as a technology play rather than a traditional carmaker stock.But many analysts are skeptical, saying the shares may not appreciate in value until the money-losing company launches its second car, the Model S.The company has yet to make a profit, and does not expect to do so until the $50,000 Model S sedan starts selling in significant volume. As of March, it had sold a little over 1,000 of its trademark $109,000 Roadsters.The equity markets are a bit fickle and this is somewhat of a speculative deal, given the company doesn't generate any profits. So I think at the margin the firm may not be able to go out there with some blockbuster size of a deal, said Morningstar IPO analyst Michael Gaiden. Institutions, however, may want some exposure to this revolutionary-type name, he added.Despite the considerable risks facing Tesla, the company is generating enthusiasm among investors, and the shares could price above the $14-$16 range.Investors are indicating a willingness to pay around $17 per share, IPO Boutique senior managing partner Scott Sweet said.The IPO represents about 14 percent of the company, excluding additional shares the underwriters have an option on. At $15 a share, Tesla would have a market capitalization of $1.4 billion.Tesla's losses widened to $29.5 million for the quarter ended March 31, from $16 million a year earlier.The company's business plan is fraught with risk. Tesla has said in regulatory filings that it faces a production gap in its Roadster after 2011 due to tooling changes at a supplier.Musk, talking to investors last week, said Tesla was closer to Silicon Valley giants than traditional automakers.We are a Silicon Valley company. Closer to an Apple or Google than to a GM or Ford in the way we operate the company, he said.Tesla would be the first U.S. car company to go public since Ford Motor Co made its public debut in 1956.Investors will be betting on the Model S. Tesla plans various cars based on the Model S, including a minivan, SUV and a mass market car, Musk said at the investor meeting, but he did not give a timeline for the launch of these vehicles.Jeremy Anwyl, chief executive of Edmunds.com, which tracks the car market, said Tesla operates in a capital-intensive business that is highly competitive, with major automakers poised to enter the electric car market.The deck is stacked against them, he said last week. They are not Google. They are in manufacturing.Underwriters on the IPO are led by Goldman Sachs & Co, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan, and Deutsche Bank Securities.(Reporting by Poornima Gupta; Editing by Derek Caney and John Wallace)""]"
